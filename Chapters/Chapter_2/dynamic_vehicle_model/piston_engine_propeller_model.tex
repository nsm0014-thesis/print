\begin{document}
A common way for small general aviation aircraft to generate propulsive forces is through use of a propeller. The Diamond DA-40 used in this thesis has a single 5 blade propeller attached to a shaft that rotates according to the torque generated by the aircraft engine. The following section describes the piston engine model, its accompanying propeller, and the electric governor that indirectly controls the thrust power generated by the aforementioned components.
