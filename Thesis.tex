    % What is being presented in this work?
    As modern technology trends towards autonomous aerial and ground vehicles, the need for high-fidelity simulations is ever present. This thesis investigates the deep coupling of a high-fidelity Flight Vehicle Dynamic Model (FVDM) with simulated Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements in both healthy and degraded scenarios.
    % Why is it important?
    Aircraft in production today are equipped with a plethora of sensors that provide redundant global position of the flight vehicle. However, although redundant, these sensors are plagued with detrimental characteristics that inhibit high-precision measurements when used alone. Deeply coupling the measurements from these sensors with GPS correlators provides robust flight vehicle localization that is well-documented. But, the foreign threat to jam and degrade GPS signals is imminent, and new solutions that fuse multiple sensors must be evaluated when GPS is not available.
    % How is the sensor fusion algorithm going to work?
    This thesis presents a deeply fused sensor fusion algorithm that incorporates the FVDM and GPS correlator measurements. The sensor fusion algorithm will be tested in scenarios of GPS-degradation or GPS-denied environments. The FVDM and GPS correlator measurements are linked together through use of vector tracking, where the propagated states from the FVDM are used to predict the changes in carrier and code phase changes, helping the GPS receiver maintain signal lock are each of the acquired satellites.
    % What are the intricacies of the Flight Vehicle Dynamic Model?
    The FVDM is a high-fidelity flight vehicle model based on the Diamond DA-40 single-propeller fixed wing aircraft. The aircraft model simulates a piston engine model that generates thrust power through a shaft that spins a numerically modeled 5-blade propeller. The speed of the propeller is controlled through a electric governor, and the pitch is controlled to maintain efficient propeller action onto the incident airflow. The aerodynamics of the aircraft are modeled a discretized aerodynamic coefficient technique, called strip theory. Although not used in this work, a landing gear model incorporates the 3 landing gear seen on the Diamond DA-40 and evaluates the forces applied during landing as a second-order spring-mass-damper system. An International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) is used to calculate the density, temperature, speed of sound, and ambient pressure based on aircraft altitude. The Horizontal-Wind-Model 14 is used to calculate winds as a function of the global position of the aircraft based on 20 years of collected data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). To close the loop of the FVDM, a set of controllers in collaboration with a waypoint manager are used to actuate the control surfaces on the aircraft. Multiple planned paths are demonstrated during this work and are presented in their respective sections.
    % Why use GPS measurements?
    For several decades, GPS has served as the backbone for attaining a global position solution on a variety of collection platforms. This ubiquity is well-documented, making GPS a practical and realistic signal to simulate for the focus of this thesis. Mainly used as medium to localize United States government entities, including the military services, means foreign threats are honing the technology needed to disrupt the GPS signal from jamming the signal-in-space to spoof the receiver by masking a GPS-like signal. These imminent threats catalyze the greater need for more research in this area on all collection platforms, including flight vehicles.
    % What results are shown in this thesis?
    This thesis investigates the performance of position estimation a simulated flight vehicle in scenarios of GPS-degradation and GPS-denied environments. Chapter 1 divulges prior art related to the investigation, while chapters 2, 3, and 4 describe the FVDM, GPS simulation and receiver architecture, and sensor fusion algorithm respectively. Chapter 5 presents the results, including a Monte-Carlo analysis of the stochastic elements within the simulations and Chapter 6 concludes the work followed by a section of future work for interested parties.

\chapter{Introduction and Background}
Redundant, accurate flight vehicle localization has been well-documented over several decades~\cite{zhaoCooperativeLocalizationBased2017,rufaSensorFusionUnmanned2014,tennyRobustNavigationUrban2022,kandemirProbabilisticMeasurementMethod2018}. However, as the threat to GPS signals continues to rise, the need for robust positioning estimation increases. While robust systems already exist to combat incoming interference, these systems are either proprietary or government controlled, making them infeasible for widespread use. Cheaper, robust systems are critical for the safe future of civilian and military flight vehicles. Civilian aircraft feature a wide sensor suite the work in tandem to provide redundancy and safety critical features to maintain safe flight. These aircraft have the space to fit these sensors and the power to run them consistently in all phases of flight (Figure~\ref{fig:weights}), more importantly, the companies that design and build these aircraft also the budget to afford such expensive sensor suites.

Smaller aircraft are not allowed these luxuries, being manufactured with fewer sensors, overall making them less safe. Table~\ref{tbl:sensorsuitecomparison} compares the different sensors onboard a civilian airliner and a civilian general aviation aircraft.

Regardless of size, the sensor suite aboard any flight vehicle is able to provide measurements 50 times greater than that of a GPS receiver, so a sensor fusion algorithm is optimal for this situation. Because sensor measurements have inherit errors due to a variety of factors, they can wander or \textit{dead reckon} through time. GPS measurements, although slower, provide measurements that do not drift at cost of being slightly less accurate. Table~\ref{tbl:sensorfusionframeworks} describes the most common sensor fusion frameworks for GPS and INS platforms.

\chapter{Flight Vehicle Model and Navigation Sensors}
The aircraft simulated and modelled in this thesis is the Diamond DA-40 single propeller fixed wing aircraft (Figure~\ref{fig:DA40}). Small General Aviation (GA) aircraft are easier to model compared to commercial and military aircraft as performance information for the mechanical components of the plane are not hidden through government or proprietary documents. The sections below detail the components of the Flight Vehicle Dynamic Model (FVDM) in its entirety along with the waypoint manager and navigation sensor used to modelled realistic low-cost sensor one might see aboard the actual Diamond DA-40. The simulation is a full 6 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) simulation and features 12 control inputs~-~ranging from throttle and control surface inputs to propeller pitch and mixture levers. These are covered in more detail at a later section. The chapter concludes with information about the stochastic elements in the model, which components are the aircraft they affect and the magnitude and frequency of the random walks.

\section{Reference Frames}
% What are reference frames
Reference frames and their transformations are a critical component to any navigation algorithm. Precise determination of a flight vehicle requires the knowledge of its position, velocity, and orientation. Reference frames describe the orientation of the flight vehicle in a global or local state. Because different components of the FVDM are physically located and oriented at unique locations of the Diamond DA-40, multiple reference frames are used to describe the forces and moments these components generate due to their placement. In order for the cumulative summation of all forces and moments generated at certain time step, reference frames transformation are used to coordinate local forces and moments into a congruent reference frame such that these calculations are performed properly. This section describes the different reference frames used in this work for the FVDM\@.
% The different reference frames on the aircraft model
% Body
\subsection{Flight Vehicle Reference Frame}
The flight vehicle reference frame or body frame describes the reference frame with origin at the center of mass of the modeled Diamond DA-40. The body frame maintains alignment shown in Figure~\ref{fig:flightvehiclereferenceframe} and remains fixed to the flight vehicle at all times. The flight vehicle reference frame is essential to the FVDM as all forces and moments are added together in the body frame before integration into global and local pose states.

\begin{figure}[!ht]\label{fig:flightvehiclereferenceframe}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{Figures/bodyframe.png}
  \caption{Standard flight vehicle reference frame used in this work.~\cite{peetSpacecraftAircraftDynamics}}
\end{figure}

% Prop
\subsection{Propeller Reference Frame}
The propeller reference frame describes the axis about which the propeller rotates with origin to the propeller nacelle, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:propnacelle}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]\label{fig:propnacelle}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/propnacelle.jpg}
  \caption{Yellow propeller nacelle on the front of a general aviation aircraft.}
\end{figure}

As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:propframe}, propeller \textit{pitch}, as it is referenced in this thesis is a rotation about the \textit{y} axis, while the blades of the propeller rotate about the \textit{x} axis. This axis remains remains fixed in orientation, but always moves with the aircraft to have the same distant from the flight vehicle reference frame.

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/propframe.png}
  \caption{The reference frame used to model the dynamic of the propeller in this work~\cite{vanarnhemEngineeringMethodEstimate2020}.}
\end{figure}

% Wind
\subsection{Local Wind Axes Reference Frame}
The local wind axes reference frame is used to calculate the lift and drag generated from their respective components with origin at the center of mass of the modeled Diamond DA-40. The orientation of the reference frame changes such that \(\Psi \) remains parallel with the trajectory of the aircraft and \(\alpha \) remains parallel to the ground below. In literature, \( \Psi \) and \(\alpha \) are referred to as the \textit{sideslip} and \textit{angle of attack} of the aircraft during flight.

\section{Dynamic Vehicle Model}
This section describes the implementation of each key component in generating the forces and moments that propel the flight vehicle model forward during flight. There are 4 main components need to simulate the aircraft at high-fidelity. The engine and propeller models serve as the main proponents in accelerating the air around the aircraft, further allowing the aerodynamic model to provide lift. The performance of both the aerodynamics and engine models are based on the condition of the ambient atmosphere that are described by the ISA atmosphere model. The section holds several subsections that describe these systems and the equations that govern them.
\clearpage
\subsection{Atmosphere Model}
In order to more accurately calculate a handful of dynamics models studied in this work, a model of Earth's atmosphere is needed to provided ambient temperature, pressure, density, speed of sound, and wind. This thesis uses the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) model to approximate ambient temperature, ambient pressure, ambient density, and the speed of sound given a certain height above Mean Sea Level (MSL). Using an assumed linear distribution for temperature as a function of altitude, the ISA model assumes hydrostatic equilibrium as seen by Equation~\ref{eq:2.1},

\begin{equation}
  \frac{dP}{dh} = -\rho \, g,
  \label{eq:2.1}
\end{equation}

where \(\frac{dP}{dh}\) is the vertical pressure gradient as a factor of air density, \( \rho \), and Earth's gravity, \(g\). After integrating Equation~\ref{eq:2.1}, the ISA model uses the ideal gas law (Equation~\ref{eq:2.2})

\begin{equation}
  P = \rho \, R\textsubscript{air} \, T
  \label{eq:2.2}
\end{equation}

to solve for the ambient pressure \(P\), and density, \( \rho \). A complete form of the ISA model is seen in Equations~\ref{eq:2.3} and~\ref{eq:2.4}.

\begin{equation}
  P = P_0\,\exp\left({\frac{-g\,\Delta h}{R\textsubscript{air}\,T}}\right)
  \label{eq:2.3}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \rho = \rho_0\,\exp\left({\frac{-g\,\Delta h}{R\textsubscript{air}\,T}}\right)
  \label{eq:2.4}
\end{equation}

where \(P_0\) and \(\rho_0\) are atmospheric layer values for pressure and density, respectively; \(R\textsubscript{air}\) is the specific gas constant for air and \(\Delta h\) is difference between the current altitude of the flight vehicle and altitude of the current atmospheric layer. The speed of sound is a function of temperature and can be calculated using Equation~\ref{eq:2.5}

\begin{equation}
  a = \sqrt{\gamma \, R\textsubscript{air}\,T},
  \label{eq:2.5}
\end{equation}

where \(a\) is the speed of sound in meters per second and \( \gamma \) is the ratio of specific heats. Figure~\ref{fig:atmos} describes these atmospheric parameters from MSL to 85,000 meters above sea level.

Along with the aforementioned atmospheric parameters, wind is a vital modeling parameter for flight vehicles. For smaller SWAP flight vehicles, small gusts of wind can greatly affect their dynamics~\cite{raymerAircraftDesignConceptual2018}. This thesis uses an updated version of the Horizontal Wind Model~\cite{drobEmpiricalModelEarth2008,drobUpdateHorizontalWind2015} using collected satellite data from the Nation Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The model accepts the current position of the flight vehicle to provide a predicted wind vector in the meridional and zonal reference frame. Implementation of the ISA model and calculation of winds can be found under \textit{Atmosphere.m} in~\cite{millerNsm0014thesis1969}.

\subsection{Piston Engine and Propeller Model}
% Overview of Piston and Propeller Model
A common way for small general aviation aircraft to generate propulsive forces is through use of a propeller. The Diamond DA-40 used in this thesis has a single 5 blade propeller attached to a shaft that rotates according to the torque generated by the aircraft engine. The following section describes the piston engine model, its accompanying propeller, and the electric governor that indirectly controls the thrust power generated by the aforementioned components.

% Manifold Pressure
The engine inlet manifold is a set of vents that allow the ambient air to feed directly into the combustion chambers where the oxygen in the air is used in combination with the fuel to generate power. Based on the commanded throttle input, these manifold vents can be closed or open to let in more or less air, and in return the engine delivers a proportional amount of power to the shaft.

% Engine Air Flow Rate
The by product of calculating the manifold pressure is also calculating the air flow rate that being combusted with the fuel to generate power to the propeller shaft. Because the air flow rate is a by product of the commanded throttle, the engine fuel to air ratio is maintained by a commanded mixture input. The mixture defines the ratio between the fuel and air volume in the engine combustion chambers. When the mixture is \textit{lean}, the chamber has larger volume of air compared to fuel. The opposite can be said when the mixture is \textit{rich}. Since the equation that govern the combustion efficiency are based on sociometric principles, the ideal fuel to air ratio is \textit{ideal}, where there equal parts air and equal parts fuel in the combustion chamber.

% Engine Shaft Power and Torque
The displacement of the piston as a result of the combustion between fuel and air in the combustion chamber correlate to an act of torque on the propeller shaft that results in the spinning of the propeller.

% Electric Governor Model
The governor that exists in ground and flight vehicles exists such that drastic changes in throttle do not result in extreme ramps of torque that could structurally damage engine components. It limits the rate of commanded throttle to be linear so that rotational acceleration of the shaft and propeller is safely increased or decreased.

% Propeller Dynamics
The purpose of an aircraft propeller is to increase the velocity of the ambient air around them such that the lifting surfaces on the aircraft can generate lift and keep the aircraft in flight. There are 3 main components to focus on when designing and manufacturing propellers. These are
\begin{itemize}
  \item[i.] Materials
  \item[ii.] Number of Blades
  \item[iii.] Blade Geometry.
\end{itemize}
While the focus of this thesis is not on details in propeller design, it is important to show how the history and differences between each of these 3 items affect the efficiency and performance a propeller has in generating thrust power for the aircraft. The first modern propeller were designed in the early 1900's. Originally made of wood, they featured 3 blades and crudely resembled airfoil shapes (Figure~\ref{fig:woodprops}).

\begin{figure}[!ht]\label{fig:woodprops}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{Figures/woodProps.jpg}
  \caption{Collection of historic wood and steel propellers~\cite{ianHowIdentifyHistoric2016}.}
\end{figure}

These propellers had a fixed pitch, meaning they could not rotate up and down during flight~-~severely costing the propeller thrust power. In 1929, Wallace Turnbull invented the variable pitch propeller, allowing pilots to control the pitch the propeller, dramatically increasing propeller efficiency during flight~\cite{ianShortHistoryAircraft2018}. Through time and the advent of computers, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses shaped a handful of equations that define the performance and efficiency of a propeller design. In this work, a 3-blade Hartzell~\cite{HartzellPropellerInc} composite propeller is used as it is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) propeller on the Diamond DA-40 aircraft. This propeller is a variable-pitch constant speed propeller, meaning the pitch of the propeller is optimally adjusted for the current flight condition, while at the same time, maintaining a constant rotational speed to conserve fuel and hold a consistent propeller efficiency (Equation~\ref{eq:propellerefficiency}).

Before the simulation is started, the propeller is analyzed through \textit{FlightStream}~\cite{FlightStream}, a surface vorticity flow solver, to analyze the propeller for its lift coefficient (\(C_L\)) at varying flight conditions (Figure~\ref{fig:flightstreamprop}).

\begin{figure}[!ht]\label{fig:flightstreamprop}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.35\linewidth]{Figures/flightstreamprop.png}
  \caption{Analyzing 3-blade propeller through Flightstream~\cite{FlightStream}.}
\end{figure}

Once the lift coefficient is determined, numerical look up tables are generated such that the calculation of the forces and moments generated by the propeller can be interpolated, allowing the simulation to be run in real time. To determine the amount of thrust and torque generated by the propeller, the \textit{Activity Factor} (Equation~\ref{eq:activityfactor}) of the propeller must first be determined. The \textit{Activity Factor} is a measures of the propellers ability to absorb propeller and the effectiveness of each blade's width.

% Activity Factor
\begin{equation}\label{eq:activityfactor}
  AF_{\textrm{per blade}} = \frac{1 \times 10^5 \, c_{\textrm{root}}}{16 \, D} \left(0.25 + 0.2 \, \lambda - 0.2 \right)
\end{equation}

Where \(AF_{\textrm{per blade}}\) is the \textit{Activity Factor} per blade, \(c_{\textrm{root}}\) is the length of a blade's chord at the root, \(D\) is the diameter of the propeller, and \( \lambda \) is the taper ratio, described in Section~\ref{section:aerodynamic}. Table~\ref{tbl:propparams} describes the design characteristics of the propeller used in this thesis.

Because the dimensions of the propeller are known, we can determine the \textit{Activity Factor} of the blade to be (Equation~\ref{eq:activityfactorcalc},~\ref{eq:activityfactorcalc2})

% Activity Factor Calculation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:activityfactorcalc}
  AF_{\textrm{per blade}} = \frac{1 \times 10^5 \, (0.1475)}{16 \, (1.9)} \left(0.25 + 0.2 \, (0.8) - 0.2 \right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:activityfactorcalc2}
  AF_{\textrm{per blade}} = 101.89.
\end{equation}

Now that the \textit{Activity Factor} is known for the modeled propeller. The \textit{Power} (Equation~\ref{eq:powercoefficient}) and \textit{Thrust} (Equation~\ref{eq:thrustcoefficient}) coefficients can be calculated to show how well the propeller generates thrust when the aircraft is static (\i.e.\ starting takeoff). For this analysis, we assume the engine to be producing a nominal \(600\) horsepower (\(447.42\) [kW]) and applying a torque equivalent to \(2200\) [rpm] (\(36.6\) [rev\(/\)s]).

% Power Coefficient
\begin{equation}\label{eq:powercoefficient}
  c_P = \frac{P}{\rho \, n^3 \, D^5}
\end{equation}

% Thrust Coefficient
\begin{equation}\label{eq:thrustcoefficient}
  c_T = \frac{T}{\rho \, n^2 \, D^4}
\end{equation}

In Equations~\ref{eq:powercoefficient} and~\ref{eq:thrustcoefficient}, \(P\) is the engine power, denoted in kiloWatts, \(n\) is the rotational speed of the shaft, denoted in revolutions per second, \(T\) is the thrust of the propeller, denoted in kiloNewtons, and \( rho \) is density of the ambient air. For these calculations, an assume sea-level density is used (1.225 [\(kg/m^3\)]). Using Figure~\ref{fig:staticpropthrust} and our nominal engine power and torque output, we can approximate the thrust coefficient (Equations~\ref{eq:calcCT1},~\ref{eq:calcCT2},~\ref{eq:calcCT3} and~\ref{eq:calcCT4}).

  \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{Figures/StaticThrust.png}
  \caption{Static propeller thrust for the modelled propeller (Adapted from~\cite{GeneralizedMethodPropeller}).}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:calcCT1}
  c_P = \frac{(447.42)(550)}{{(1.225)} \, {(36.6)}^3 \, {(1.9)}^5}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:calcCT2}
  c_P = 0.16547
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:calcCT3}
  \frac{C_T}{C_P}(@C_P == 0.16547) = 1.1544
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:calcCT4}
  C_T = 0.18997
\end{equation}


Mapping \(C_T\) and \(C_P\) allows for computationally inexpensive queries with calculating propeller efficiency during flight (Equation~\ref{eq:propellerefficiency}).
% Propeller Efficiency
\begin{equation}\label{eq:propellerefficiency}
  \eta_P = \frac{C_T}{C_P} \, J
\end{equation}

Propeller efficiency, \( \eta_P \) compares the amount of power produced by the engine and shaft to the amount of power applied to the ambient air~-~an ideal propeller efficiency would be \(1\), where all of the produced engine power is used to accelerate the ambient air. The \textit{Advance Ratio}, \(J\)
% Advance Ratio
\begin{equation}\label{eq:advanceRatio}
  J = \frac{V}{n \, D} \, ,
\end{equation}

describes how far the flight vehicle moves at each full revolution of the propeller.
\(V\) is the forward velocity of the flight vehicle, \(n\) is the rotational speed of the propeller and \(D\) is the propeller diameter.

The final step in calculating the forces and moments generated by the propeller is querying the thrust based on the previous equations (Equation~\ref{eq:thrust}).
% Thrust
\begin{equation}\label{eq:thrust}
  T = \frac{P \, \eta_P}{V}
\end{equation}

A handful of steps, provided below, list the necessary calculations needed to simulate the thrust for the Diamond DA-40 modeled in this thesis. Because of some of the quantities are constant (i.e.\ propeller diameter and lift coefficient), look up tables can be created before hand to lower the computational load.

\begin{itemize}
  \item[1.] Calculate Activity Factor for given propeller design (Equation~\ref{eq:activityfactor}).
  \item[2.] Query coefficients data table (Figure~\ref{fig:staticpropthrust}) to define \textit{Power} and \textit{Thrust} coefficients (Equations~\ref{eq:powercoefficient} and~\ref{eq:thrustcoefficient}).
  \item[3.] Query \textit{Advance Ratio} (Equation~\ref{eq:advanceRatio}) data table for given flight velocity and shaft rotational speed.
  \item[4.] Calculate \( \eta_P \) (Equation~\ref{eq:propellerefficiency}), for given \(J\), \(C_P\), and \(C_T\).
  \item[5.] Calculate \(T\) using Equation~\ref{eq:thrust}.
  \item[6.] The moment generated by the propeller is simply the cross-product between the thrust and moment arm between the tip of the propeller and the nacelle of propeller.

\subsection{Aerodynamic Modeling}\label{section:aerodynamic}
Once in the air, aircraft must be efficient at generating lift forces on the airframe to sustain flight. Since the early 1920's, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) started tested oblique elliptical shapes in wind tunnels known as \textit{airfoils}. A wind tunnel is a machine that generates straight-line \textit{wind} to simulate the testing object flying through the air (Figure~\ref{fig:windtunnel}).

  \includegraphics[width=.75\linewidth]{Figures/opencircuitwindtunnel.jpg}
  \caption{Subsonic wind tunnel in Auburn University's Aerodynamics Laboratory.}
\end{figure}

For the aircraft presented in this thesis, a \textit{Wortmann FX 63{-}137} is used. Figure~\ref{fig:airfoil} shows the side profile.

\begin{figure}[!ht]\label{fig:airfoil}

\clearpage
\subsection{Landing Gear Model}
Although not calculated often, the modeling of the aircraft's landing gear are important and should not be overlooked. However, because of the flight paths investigated in this thesis focus solely on the aircraft during flight, a simplified dynamic model is used to describe the forces and moments acting on the landing gear during landing. It should be noted that the aerodynamic calculations of the landing gear occur in the aerodynamically modeling section, while this section focuses on the moments and forces generated from the runway opposing the weight of the aircraft.

To describe the forces and moments generated during landing, a mass-spring damper system (Figure~\ref{fig:ldgfbd}) can be used in simulate the the struts, levers, and tire depression (Figure~\ref{fig:ldg}) that absorb much of the forces, moments and vibrations that act onto the aircraft during landing.

\begin{figure}[!ht]\label{fig:ldgfbd}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.4\linewidth]{Figures/ldgfbd.drawio.png}
  \caption{Mass-spring damper system, representing the components of landing gear on the aircraft (adapted from~\cite{xingStrengthAnalysisDiagonal2012}).}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!ht]\label{fig:ldg}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.75\linewidth]{Figures/LandingGear.png}
  \caption{Identification of the landing gear components on the Diamond DA40.}
\end{figure}

Expanding Newton's second law, the forces on each landing gear are solved in the vertical direction (Equation~\ref{eq:ldgforces})

\begin{equation}
  \sum F^i_z = m\,a_z = k^i_t\, \Delta z_t\, + \, k^i_{ldg}\, \Delta z_{a/c}\, + c^i_{ldg}\, \Delta \dot{z}_t,
  \label{eq:ldgforces}
\end{equation}

where \(k^i_{ldg}\) and \(c^i_{ldg}\) are the spring and damper coefficients of the struts and levers respectively (see Table~\ref{tbl:ldgcoeff} for the values used in this simulated model). \(\Delta z_{a/c}\) and \(\Delta \dot{z}_t\), are the deflection and rate of deflection of the aircraft during landing.\( k^i_t \) and \(\Delta z_t\) are the tire \textit{spring} coefficient and tire depression respectively. For a general aviation aircraft, the depression of the tire upon landing is relatively small such that this term is thrown out.

\begin{table}[!ht]\label{tbl:ldgcoeff}
  \caption{List of spring and damper coefficients for nose and rear landing gear.}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{cccc}
    \toprule
    \textbf{i} & \textbf{Location} & \(\mathbf{k}\) \(  \left[\frac{kN}{m}\right]\) & \(\mathbf{c}\) \( \left[\frac{kN\,s}{m}\right]\) \\
    \midrule
    1          & Nose              & \(50\)                                         & \(11.3\)                                         \\
    2          & Rear Right        & \(80\)                                         & \(14.3\)                                         \\
    3          & Rear Left         & \(80\)                                         & \(14.3\)                                         \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The observed moments are solved by taking the cross product between the calculated forces of each landing gear and the moment arm (Equation~\ref{eq:ldgmoments}).

\begin{equation}
  \sum M^i = \textnormal{cross}([\,0\,;\,0\,;\,F^i_z\,],[\,x^i\,;\,y^i\,;\,z^i\,])
  \label{eq:ldgmoments}
\end{equation}

In Equation~\ref{eq:ldgmoments}, \(x^i\), \(y^i\), and \(z^i\) represent the moment arm that is derived from the center of gravity for the aircraft down to where each tire makes contact with the ground.

As a final note, it should be made clear that the forces and moments that act upon the landing gear if and only if a tire has made contact with the ground, for computational efficiency.

\subsection{Forces and Moments Calculations}
The final product of all the aforementioned systems sums to 2 things~-~the forces and moments acting on the body of the aircraft. This work demonstrates the high-fidelity modelling of engines, propellers, landing gear, and aerodynamic forces and moments the simulated flight vehicles generates while in flight. The final step of these calculations is to add them together in the body-fixed \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\) directions. This is demonstrated by Equation~\ref{eq:sumForce} and Equation~\ref{eq:sumMoments}.

\begin{equation}
  \sum \mathbf{F} = \mathbf{F}_{prop} + \mathbf{F}_{aero} + \mathbf{F}_{LDG}
  \label{eq:sumForce}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \sum \mathbf{M} = \mathbf{M}_{prop} + \mathbf{M}_{aero} + \mathbf{M}_{LDG}
  \label{eq:sumMoments}
\end{equation}

It should be noted that \(\mathbf{F}_{LDG}\) and \(\mathbf{M}_{LDG}\) are only calculated when the aircraft is landing.

Once the forces and moments are calculated, linear and angular velocities, along with their respective positions can be calculated.

\section{Guidance System}
For commercial flights, it is important for the aircraft to know where the final destination is and how to fly there in an efficient and effective manner. These questions are usually answered by the guidance system and the pilots are provided a flight plan before taking off. The guidance system provides a time series of instructions to feed into the aircraft control to mandate the speed of the aircraft, the altitude of the aircraft, and what radius to bank about with making turns along the journey to the final destination. A similar guidance system is implemented for simulated flight vehicle demonstrated in this thesis.

\chapter{GPS Simulator and Software Defined Receiver}
Since 1993, the Global Positioning System (GPS) has provided users with capable hardware to determine their global position within seconds and in recent developments, a centimeter-level position error. GPS can be explained in 3 components: the satellite vehicles in space, control and transmission of signals, and the receiver processing component.

GPS satellites have undergone multiple improvements and upgrades since the first satellites were launched in 1978. These versions of satellites are based on their \textit{block}. Currently, Block III is the most advanced satellite orbiting Earth today. Early versions (Block I) of GPS satellites were used mainly for development and did not transmit signals to the public. Lessons learned from the Block I satellites were fully integrated into the Block II GPS satellites, where GPS became fully operational in 1993. While there were many subtle differences between Block I and Block II satellites, the most important difference is that these new satellites broadcasted a signal on 2 frequencies, coined \textit{L1}, \textit{L2}, and \textit{L2c}, where \textit{L2c} is intended for civilian use. Modern day Block III satellites transmit their signal on the same frequencies that Block II satellites have, with the addition of \textit{L5}. Table provides the frequencies that signals are transmitted on.
