  abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of target handoff between two fixed wing aircrafts that do not have access to Global Positioning Systems. The problem requires estimating the relative pose between the vehicles. We assume that onboard inertial measurement units can provide roll and pitch estimates of the aircraft attitude. We examine the observability of other relative states needed to do the handoff problem. In particular, we consider two different scenarios. In the first scenario, we assume that the relative position between the aircrafts is measured, as would be the case for a radar or a lidar sensor. We assume that the two aircrafts do not exchange their airspeed and turn rate information. Under mild assumptions, we show that the relative heading between the two aircrafts is observable. In the second scenario, we assume that only the bearing angle between the two aircrafts is measured, as would be the case for a vision sensor. We prove state observability for maneuvers that are relevant to target tracking and handoff. We also present an estimation algorithm that uses a bank of extended Kalman filters to estimate the relative states. Simulation results with full vehicle dynamics demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

Because of the unique INS-aided loop structure, the deeply coupled system performs very well in highly dynamic environments. In practice, vehicle maneuvering has a big influence on the performance of IMUs (Inertial Measurement Unit), and determining whether the selected IMUs and receiver parameters satisfy the loop dynamic requirement is still a critical problem for deeply coupled systems. Aiming at this, a new parameter self-calibration method based on the norm principle is proposed which explains the relationship between IMU precision and the velocity error of the system; the method will also provide a detailed solution to calculate the loop steady-state tracking error, so it will eventually make a judgment about the stability of the tracking loop under present system parameter settings. Lastly, a full digital simulation platform is set up, and the results of simulations show good agreement with the proposed method.},

  abstract = {In urban environments, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals are frequently attenuated, blocked or reflected, which degrades the positioning accuracy of GNSS receivers significantly. To improve the performance of GNSS receiver for vehicle urban navigation, a GNSS/INS deeply-coupled software defined receiver (GIDCSR) with a low cost micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) inertial measurement unit (IMU) ICM-20602 is presented, in which both GPS and BDS constellations are supported. Two key technologies, that is, adaptive open-close tracking loops and INS aided pseudo-range weight control algorithm, are applied in the GIDCSR to enhance the signal tracking continuity and positioning accuracy in urban areas. To assess the performance of the proposed deep couple solution, vehicle field tests were carried out in GNSS-challenged urban environments. With the adaptive open-close tracking loops, the deep couple output carrier phase in the open sky, and improved pseudo-range accuracy before and after GNSS signal blocked. Applying the INS aided pseudo-range weight control, the pseudo-range gross errors of the deep couple decreased caused by multipath. A popular GNSS/INS tightly-coupled vehicle navigation kit from u-blox company, M8U, was tested side by side as benchmark. The test results indicate that in the GNSS-challenged urban areas, the pseudo-range quality of GIDCSR is at least 25\% better than that of M8U, and GIDCSR’s horizontal positioning results are at least 69\% more accurate than M8U’s.},

Noise sources, obtained using the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings acoustic analogy applied to scale-resolved flow simulation data, are stored on a hemisphere surrounding the vehicle. These noise sources are propagated using a propagation model that takes into account the vertical variability of air temperature and wind velocity. The electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, presented by Casalino, van der Velden, and Romani [(2019). in Proceedings of the AIAA Scitech 2019 Forum, January 7–11, San Diego, CA, pp. 1834–1851], is used as a case study; noise footprints, obtained considering various vertically varying temperature and wind velocity distributions, are compared. It is shown that weather conditions in the acoustic wave propagation can contribute to mismatch up to 4 dBA in the illuminated zone and a significant drop in the refractive shadow zone caused by the vertical air temperature and wind velocity gradients. This work constitutes the first accomplishment in including realistic atmospheric effects in aircraft community noise prediction based on scale-resolved flow simulations.},

  abstract = {Aircraft trajectory prediction requires the determination of the atmospheric properties (pressure, temperature, and density) encountered by the aircraft during its flight. This is accomplished by employing a tabulated prediction published by a meteorological service, a static atmosphere model that does not consider the atmosphere variation with time or horizontal position, such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standard Atmosphere (ISA), or a variation to the later so it better conforms with the expected flight conditions. This article proposes an easy-to-use quasi static model that introduces temperature and pressure variations while respecting all the hypotheses of the ISA model, resulting in more realistic trajectory predictions as the obtained atmospheric properties bear a higher resemblance with the local conditions encountered during the flight. The proposed model relies on two parameters, the temperature and pressure offsets, and converges to the ISA model when both are zero. Expressions to obtain the atmospheric properties are established, and their dependencies with both parameters explained. The author calls this model INSA (ICAO Non Standard Atmosphere) and releases its C++ implementation as open-source software.},

  abstract = {Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) inertial navigation exhibits an extreme dependency on the availability of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) signals, without which it incurs in a slow but unavoidable position drift that may ultimately lead to the loss of the platform if the GNSS signals are not restored or the aircraft does not reach a location from which it can be recovered by remote control. This article describes an stochastic high fidelity simulation of the flight of a fixed wing low SWaP (size, weight, and power) autonomous UAV in turbulent and varying weather intended to test and validate the GNSS-Denied performance of different navigation algorithms. Its open-source \textbackslash nm\{\textbackslash CC\} implementation has been released and is publicly available. Onboard sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, a Pitot tube, an air data system, a GNSS receiver, and a digital camera, so the simulation is valid for inertial, visual, and visual inertial navigation systems. Two scenarios involving the loss of GNSS signals are considered: the first represents the challenges involved in aborting the mission and heading towards a remote recovery location while experiencing varying weather, and the second models the continuation of the mission based on a series of closely spaced bearing changes. All simulation modules have been modeled with as few simplifications as possible to increase the realism of the results. While the implementation of the aircraft performances and its control system is deterministic, that of all other modules, including the mission, sensors, weather, wind, turbulence, and initial estimations, is fully stochastic. This enables a robust evaluation of each proposed navigation system by means of Monte-Carlo simulations that rely on a high number of executions of both scenarios.},

  abstract = {The United States has the largest and most diverse general aviation (GA) community in the world, with more than 220,000 aircraft, flying almost 23million hours annually. Accurate and economic estimating the exhaust emissions of general aviation will effectively support the practice of mitigating the environmental impacts from general aviation. Fuel flow rate in each phase of the Landing and Takeoff Cycle is one of the necessary factors recommended by the International Civil Aviation Organization to be used to estimate the exhaust emissions. This paper explores statistical models of predicting the fuel flow rate of piston-engine aircraft using general aviation flight operational data, including the aircraft altitude, the ground speed, and the vertical speed. A machine learning technique is applied to adapt the variability of flight operational data due to flexible operations of general aviation and random errors in flight data. The Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and the Smoothing Spline ANOVA (SS-ANOVA) are adopted as the modeling approaches. The modeling results are compared and interpreted from the standpoint of general aviation phases of flight in the Landing and Takeoff Cycle. Both models demonstrate good accuracy in predicting the fuel flow rate. The CART model provides intuitive outputs by the phases of flight, and is more robust to flight data outliers. The SS-ANOVA model is relatively more accurate in predicting the fuel flow rate, and is better at explaining the interaction between variables. A robust fuel flow rate prediction model of predicting the fuel flow rate of piston-engine aircraft is believed to be practical and economic for GA exhaust emissions estimation.},

This paper studies the jamming mitigation performance of deep GNSS-INS coupling when a low-cost MEMS inertial measurement unit (IMU) is being used. Deep coupling refers to the integration architecture which implements inertial-aided vector GNSS tracking instead of independent (scalar) tracking loops. In this paper the most important equations involved in noncoherent deep coupling are presented and the tracking performance using the MEMS IMU is compared to the performance obtained using the true antenna position instead of inertial navigation computations. Moreover, the convergence of the integration filter is investigated in the case where only four satellites are available. The results show that the MEMS IMU cannot quite bridge a jamming period of 35 seconds but still outperforms standard unassisted scalar tracking. Moreover, it is observed that an adverse satellite geometry significantly slows down the convergence of the accelerometer bias states of the integration filter while some other states reach a steady state normally.},

  abstract = {Traditional Deeply Integrated (DI) algorithms combines the receiver signal tracking loops and the IMU and the navigation filter function into an integrated filter. In this case, the filter rapidly operates on the receiver-tracking loop I and Q signals which are at a basic level and the IMU measurements to estimate navigation information. In this paper, we propose a federated zero-reset (FZR) method for coherent Deeply Integration, where multiple pre-filters are used (one per satellite) at a relatively high data rate working with the I and Q of the correlator outputs. The outputs from these pre-filters are next used in one composite Kalman Filter operations at a relatively low data rate. Results of software simulations are presented which offers significant tracking performance in Low carrier-to-noise and high g environment.},

Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and inertial measurement unit measurements are fused in an extended Kalman filter (EKF) which uses the VDM as the main process model. Control inputs from the autopilot system are used to drive the navigation solution. Using a predefined trajectory with segments of both high and low dynamics and a variable wind profile, Monte Carlo simulations reveal a degrading performance in varying periods of GNSS outage lasting 10 s, 20 s, 30 s, 60 s and 90 s, respectively. These are followed by periods of re-acquisition where the navigation solution recovers. With a GNSS outage lasting less than 60 s, the position error gradually grows to a maximum of 8·4 m while attitude errors in roll and pitch remain bounded, as opposed to an inertial navigation system (INS)/GNSS approach in which the navigation solution degrades rapidly. The model-based approach shows improved navigation performance even with parameter uncertainties over a conventional INS/GNSS integration approach.},

  abstract = {Accurate, reliable, and robust global positioning system (GPS) localization is desirable for many navigation applications. Unfortunately, it is challenging for a single GPS receiver to always provide accurate positioning solutions. In urban environments, intermittent signal availability leads to degraded GPS signal tracking and position estimation of the single GPS receiver. In addition, equipment malfunction of the single GPS receiver results in inaccurate navigation solutions. This paper presents a deeply coupled multireceiver vector tracking (MRVT) architecture that improves the reliability and robustness of GPS signal tracking and position estimation. MRVT jointly tracks GPS signals received by multiple GPS receivers, mitigating GPS signal tracking disruptions, improving the reliability of GPS localization in periods of intermittent signal availability. In addition, the MRVT receiver is more robust to equipment malfunctions than the single GPS receiver. We implemented an MRVT receiver using commercial radio frequency front ends and our PyGNSS software. We experimentally validated the reliability of our MRVT receiver in periods of intermittent GPS availability experienced in downtown San Francisco. Our MRVT receiver exhibited consistent GPS signal tracking and position estimation as compared to vector tracking. In addition, we experimentally validated the robustness of our MRVT receiver to the failure of a single GPS receiver.},

  abstract = {The integration of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System(BDS) and the Inertial Navigation System(INS) can provide a more reliable and accurate navigation service than either system alone. The deeply coupled architecture for BDS and INS integration has more superior performance than the loosely coupled or the tightly coupled. Owing to the complicated dynamic scenario and the nonlinear system's noise uncertainty, the adaptive Kalman filter(AKF) algorithm is often adopted in the deep integration(DI) system. The adaptive Sage window methods including innovation-based adaptive estimation(IAE) and residual-based adaptive estimation(RAE) are widely applied in AKF algorithms, but they have several limitations. We propose an improved adaptive unscented Kalman filter(AUKF) based on forgetting-factor-weight smoothing and multi-factor adaptation to overcome these limitations. Compared with the Sage window methods, the improved AUKF algorithm is immune to the quantity change of the satellites concerning integration and more sensitive to present dynamic. Furthermore, it can reduce the computation and storage burden in implementation. A simulation test based on a software platform and the deeply integrated BDS/INS navigation system is carried out to evaluate the performance of the improved AUKF. Simulation results show that the improved AUKF algorithm outperforms the extended Kalman filter(EKF) and has a similar performance with the RAE-AUKF.},

  abstract = {Synchronisation of the received Pseudorandom (PRN) code and its locally generated replica is fundamental when estimating user position in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers. It has been observed through experiments that user position accuracy decreases if sampling frequency is an integer multiple of the nominal code rate. This paper provides an accuracy analysis based on the number of samples and the residual code phase of each code chip. The outcomes reveal that the distribution of residual code phases in the code phase range [0, 1/               n                                s                              ), where n                                s                              is the number of samples per code chip, is the root cause of accuracy degradation, rather than the ratio between sampling frequency and nominal code rate.

There are several kinds of deeply-coupled structures. These can be divided mainly into coherent and non-coherent prefilter based structures, which have their own strong advantages and disadvantages, especially in accuracy and robustness. In this paper, the existing pre-filters of the deeply-coupled structures are analyzed and modified to improve them firstly. Then, an adaptive GNSS/ INS deeply-coupled algorithm with hybrid pre-filters processing is proposed to combine the advantages of coherent and non-coherent structures. An adaptive hysteresis controller is designed to implement the hybrid pre-filters processing strategy. The simulation and vehicle test results show that the adaptive deeply-coupled algorithm with hybrid pre-filters processing can effectively improve navigation accuracy and robustness, especially in a GNSS-challenged environment.},

  abstract = {A well-designed tracking loop is the core of a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver and plays a decisive role in estimating parameters and positioning. To solve the problem that classical scalar tracking may fail to track the received signal frequently in high-dynamic and weak signal environments, novel tracking loops based on optimal estimation are proposed by many researchers. Among them, Kalman-based and vector tracking are expected to have a better performance in improving the precision of measurements and positions. Considering their superiority and promising applications in deeply coupled GNSS/ inertial navigation system, the theoretical analysis and practical implementation are worthy of being further explored. In this paper, an EKF-based tracking loop which uses the outputs of coherent channels directly is proposed. And then, the implementation of a vector tracking frequency-locked and delay-locked loop is further proposed in detail. At last, the performance and superiority of the two methods are tested where a software-defined receiver is constructed and the aircraft data from a GNSS constellation simulator is used. Compared with scalar tracking, a significant improvement on positioning and measuring parameters is achieved by the two methods. And the vector tracking indicates a 42.9\% and a increase on the precision of positioning and pseudo-range measuring respectively.},

  abstract = {A GNSS/INS deeply-coupled system can improve the satellite signals tracking performance by INS aiding tracking loops under dynamics. However, there was no literature available on the complete modeling of the INS branch in the INS-aided tracking loop, which caused the lack of a theoretical tool to guide the selections of inertial sensors, parameter optimization and quantitative analysis of INS-aided PLLs. This paper makes an effort on the INS branch in modeling and parameter optimization of phase-locked loops (PLLs) based on the scalar-based GNSS/INS deeply-coupled system. It establishes the transfer function between all known error sources and the PLL tracking error, which can be used to quantitatively evaluate the candidate inertial measurement unit (IMU) affecting the carrier phase tracking error. Based on that, a steady-state error model is proposed to design INS-aided PLLs and to analyze their tracking performance. Based on the modeling and error analysis, an integrated deeply-coupled hardware prototype is developed, with the optimization of the aiding information. Finally, the performance of the INS-aided PLLs designed based on the proposed steady-state error model is evaluated through the simulation and road tests of the hardware prototype.},

  abstract = {The integration of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) with an inertial navigation system (INS) can provide accurate and reliable navigation information using a data fusing algorithm such as a Kalman filter. There has been much interest in the absolute accuracy with dominant components of mid-term and long-term errors in current research works related to the GNSS/INS navigation systems, whereas few research works focus on the relative accuracy on different time scales. However, new applications of GNSS/INS integration, such as position and orientation system for mobile mapping systems and the GNSS/INS deeply-coupled receiver, require the relative accuracy on different time scales, especially that of the short-term accuracy. This paper raises the importance of the short-term accuracy of the GNSS/INS systems in certain applications. Current methods to evaluate the navigation accuracy are mainly to provide some statistical values that can represent the overall error level (e.g., RMS), but cannot show the relative accuracy. Allan variance is a method of representing root mean square (RMS) random drift error as a function of average time. An Allan variance analysis method is proposed in this paper to evaluate the relative accuracy on different time scales of GNSS/INS systems. The feasibility of the idea was verified by the road test results of different grades of GNSS/INS systems. The results show that Allan variance can give the levels of the navigation accuracy of the GNSS/INS systems on different time scales in an effective way, especially for the short-term accuracy.},
