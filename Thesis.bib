  abstract = {Visual information are among the useful sources that can be used to localize a smartphone device. Visual information can be used in the process of image matching based on a pre-built database and Visual Map (A map tagged with images). There are different number of feature detection/description algorithms. These algorithms vastly differ in the accuracy, space usage and average matching time for each image. The color information obtained using these methods is typically ignored during the further processing steps. This paper investigates and compares thirteen different descriptors for Visual Finger Printing (VFP) localization of smartphones. These descriptors can be divided into three categories; color histogram, color-moment and Scale Invariant Feature Transformation (SIFT) based algorithms. These descriptors except for the original SIFT are all based on the colored information. Four spaces, RGB, opponent, transformed and HSV are represented in the results.},

The navigation approach is based on a carrier phase-based software-defined receiver (SDR), which tracks LTE signals and provides aiding corrections to an inertial measurement unit (IMU) in a tightly-coupled fashion via an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The indoor positioning framework employs an outdoor receiver, referred to as the base, which estimates the unknown clock biases of LTE eNodeBs and shares these estimates with the indoor navigating receiver. The availability and strength of received LTE signals indoors is evaluated in different conditions: different floor levels and in rooms with and without windows. It is demonstrated that the received carrier-to-noise ratio C/N0 in all such conditions is 48-80 dB-Hz. The performance of the developed system is evaluated in an indoor environment over a trajectory of 109 m using a tactical-grade IMU. The two-dimensional position root mean-squared error (RMSE) for the proposed LTE-IMU system is demonstrated to be 3.52 m with a standard deviation of 3.85 m and a maximum error of 8.1 m. In contrast, the IMU-only system provided an RMSE of 9.91 m with a standard deviation of 9.67 m and a maximum error of 22.53 m.},

In the proposed framework, a software-defined receiver (SDR) is developed to extract carrier phase measurements from received 5G signals. The SDR utilizes the time-domain orthogonality of the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based 5G signals. A so-called ultimate synchronization signal (USS) to combine all available resources is proposed. The proposed 5G SDR includes two stages: (i) acquisition stage, in which only unique USS resources are utilized to detect the hearable gNBs and (ii) tracking stage, in which the entire USS is utilized to produce 5G carrier phase measurements. These measurements are processed in an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to assess the navigation performance of the proposed 5G opportunistic SDR. Experimental results are presented of an UAV navigating with the proposed 5G SDR, while receiving signals from four 5G base stations (known as gNBs).

  abstract = {In the last decade, Model Predictive Control has drawn much attention from both academia and industry to be a successful guidance and control algorithm in autonomous driving because of its ability to handle complex nonlinear constrained systems, especially with the rapidly expanding technologies that enable fast implementation of its optimization problem. This paper considers NonCooperative Distributed Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) for simultaneous trajectory tracking and collision avoidance of connected autonomous/semi-autonomous vehicles. The connected vehicles are considered as a Network Control System (NCS) of dynamically decoupled agents with only coupling constraints, and it is formulated as a distributed Optimal Control Problem (OCP). It is assumed that the connected vehicles have a communication link to exchange their intentions. The coordination among the agents is achieved by Priority-Based techniques where a priority is assigned for each one to satisfy the prediction consistency. For each agent, a nonlinear bicycle model is used to predict a sequence of the states and then optimize it with respect to a sequence of control inputs. The objective function of the OCP is to track the planned trajectory. In order to achieve a normal driving behavior, comfort driving, and provide consistency of the simplified kinematic model with the actual complex vehicle model, constraints are added to the control inputs and their rate of change. In order to achieve collision avoidance among the networked vehicles, a geometric shape must be selected to represent the vehicle geometry. In this paper, an elliptic disk is selected for that as it represents the geometry of the vehicle better that the traditional circular one. A separation condition between each pair of elliptic disks is formulated as timevarying state constraints for the OCP, and is proved by developing sufficient conditions for the separation. The algorithm is validated using MATLAB simulation with the aid of ACADO toolkit.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to assess the performance of a newly developed algorithm for visual-inertial navigation of robotic systems in GNSS-denied environments. In the proposed algorithm, the fusion of position and heading information from inertial sensors and a camera was tested in an indoor environment. The algorithm is based on a loosely-coupled extended Kalman filter (EKF) that integrates the position and attitude estimates from the three-dimensional reduced inertial sensor system (3D-RISS) and a visual odometry (VO) algorithm that processes consecutive camera frames. Three accelerometers, one gyroscope, and wheel odometers are used rather than a full inertial measurement unit (IMU) to minimize increasing gyroscope drifting errors. The VO based ego-motion estimation is achieved through multiple steps, namely (1) a feature detector that periodically runs to detect new features appearing in the camera's field of view, (2) optical flow applied in a pyramidal scheme (Lucas-Kanade algorithm) to track the displacement of recently detected features between consecutive camera frames, and (3) an estimation of the essential matrix to provide the platform's motion in the world frame. The decomposition of the essential matrix into rotation and translation parameters allows for transforming the motion into metric measurements. Since monocular VO is employed in this paper, the odometer provides the scale transformation parameter. The proposed method is examined in an indoor environment to evaluate the positioning performance on a teleoperated unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). Loop closure errors at the meter-level were obtained for trajectories of more than 250 meters extended over several minutes.},

Moreover, it’s essential for taking the shortest route to save fuel and protect the environment from excessive pollution. mainly, Global Navigation Satellite systems (GNSS) are the fundamental choice for such application. however, In urban canyons, the GNSS suffer from signal blockage due to the highrisebuildings in such environments. therefore, Inertial Navigation Systems(INS) such as reduced inertial sensor sytstem (RISS) are utilized to backup the GNSS during their outages. on the other hand, the RISS solution drifts over time. A Radar-based RISS is utilized to overcome the regular RISS drawbacks by utilizing the adaptive cruise control FMCW radar for speed measuring. in this paper, a fuzzy based fusion algorithm is introduced to improve the forward speed measurements from the speedometer and radar. Also, an integration algorithm using extended kalman filter (EKF) is developed to produce a more precise solution. The proposed system has been tested on a real road trajectory in a urban area and involved various GNSS outages.

  abstract = {The Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as Global Positioning System (GPS) are the prime land and autonomous vehicles navigation information source. However, urban canyons high rise buildings block the GPS signal. Therefore, the Inertial Navigation System (INS) or the Reduced Inertial Sensor System (RISS) are utilized as an alternative source of the navigation information. The RISS is able to produce a full navigation solution using less number of sensors and calculations. Dramatically, the RISS solution drifts over time as the INS system. The integration between the GPS and the RISS is mitigating each system drawbacks. However, during the GPS outage periods, the navigation system is only depending on the inertial measurements. The RISS is utilizing the odometer/speedometer to measure the vehicle’s forward speed. Many types of error affect the odometer measurements. These errors are either due to the vehicle’s specifications as the differences in wheel diameters, and/or inefficient wheelbase or the road nature as wheel slips, uneven road surfaces, and/or skidding. In this paper, a Radar-based RISS system is introduced to take place the traditional RISS or INS systems. The radar unit is an essential part of the adaptive cruise control (ACC) system. Furthermore, it is capable of measuring the relative velocity and distance between the carrying and the in front vehicle to reduce collisions and increase the safety of driving. In addition, the radar measurements are not affected by the error sources that affect the odometer. The idea is to invest the ground reflection and derive the forward speed of the onboard vehicle as the ACC keep a safe distance between the cars. A novel method based on extracting the ground reflection features is introduced to obtain the onboard vehicle’s speed. The obtained speed is utilized with two accelerometers and one vertical gyroscope to produce the Radar-based RISS system. The proposed system has been integrated with the GPS producing a Radar-based RISS/GPS integrated navigation system. The system has been tested on a real road trajectory in a downtown area and involved several GPS signal outages. The results show the significant capabilities of the proposed system in keeping the navigation solution drift to a minimum especially when the GPS signal is in outage compared with the traditional RISS/GPS system.},

  abstract = {Navigation solutions have become a vital part of our lives and a precise positioning solution is required everywhere. The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is the most commonly used technology in navigation and positioning along with the Inertial Navigation System (INS). Generally, the low-cost GNSS receivers provide a reliable positioning solution with meter level accuracy when there is a direct line of sight between the receiver’s antenna and at least four satellites. However, this accuracy is degraded in challenging environments such as in urban areas where the solution provided by the GNSS is degraded due to multipath, poor satellite geometry and possibly complete satellite signal blockage. Therefore, to overcome the aforementioned limitations, integration with a coupling of inertial sensors and possibly an odometer is usually employed. To formulate such navigation solution from both, the odometer and inertial sensors, the three-dimensional reduced inertial sensor system (3D-RISS) algorithm has been developed to integrate with GNSS using an optimal estimation technique such as a Kalman filter. Despite the latter integration, in areas such as in urban areas and downtown cores where GNSS receivers may in incur prolonged outages, the solution relying on inertial technology is prone to rapid drift resulting in very large position errors. In fact, this has been the main reason why other sensors such as Radars, cameras, and LiDARs have been explored in the past few years to provide more reliable position updates through challenging GNSS environments. This paper focuses on exploring the benefits of using LiDAR to be integrated with the 3D-RISS in order to bridge GNSS outages in challenging urban environment by showing the performance on real road test experiments that were conducted in downtown Toronto.},

  abstract = {In dense urban areas, GNSS signals are blocked and reflected by the buildings, severely degrading the positioning accuracy. By using 3D mapping of the buildings to predict which signals are visible and which are blocked, the accuracy can be substantially improved. Many different techniques have been demonstrated since the start of the decade, showing that errors can be reduced from tens of meters to a few meters. However, a practical implementation of 3D mapping aided (3DMA) GNSS must also be computationally efficient enough to run in real time on a mobile device and, at the same time, be able to handle initialisation errors of the order of 100m. Here, we present the real-time implementation of UCL’s 3DMA GNSS algorithms on Android devices, exploiting the “raw” measurements supplied by the latest GNSS chipsets. We have developed demonstrator apps for Central London and Downtown San Francisco and Downtown Miami. In London and San Francisco, we achieve a root mean square (RMS) horizontal position accuracy of about 6m, compared with about 40m using a conventional GNSS positioning algorithm. The paper will briefly summarize the 3DMA GNSS algorithms, describe the implementation of the Android app, presenting some positioning results using both single-epoch and multi-epoch versions of the 3DMA GNSS approach, and show how accuracy can be traded off against speed. The steps needed to take the 3DMA GNSS app from a research demonstrator to a full service will then be discussed.},

  abstract = {Unlike GPS, GLONASS observations are affected by the Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) satellite signal structure, which introduces inter-frequency channel biases (ICBs) and other system biases. The effects of these biases are visible in the pseudorange and carrier-phase residuals, which affect GNSS Precise Point Positioning (PPP) convergence period, un-differenced ambiguity resolution and overall positioning accuracy. Current research has shown the correlation between receiver stations from heterogeneous networks, such as the International GNSS Service (IGS), in PPP processing and the increase in magnitude of the pseudorange and carrierphase ICBs in GLONASS-only PPP solutions. Discounting other system biases which may be present, the correlation is due to mixed receiver and antenna hardware types, differences in firmware versions, and irregularities in the updates of the receiver equipment at the stations.},

Key differences between the estimated slant ionospheric term and GIM delays were presented and discussed. One of the objectives was to answer to the question: How precise does GIM or regional corrections have to be in order to further improve PPP float and fixed solutions in comparison to the estimated slant ionospheric delays? The answer, though satellite dependent, ranges from a few decimetres to the metre-level. The correlation between the choice of GIM product and how it impacts multi-GNSS PPP convergence was also investigated using predicted and post-processed products, either combined from different Analysis Centers (ACs) or standalone. It was deduced that the choice of products, whether they are predicted, combined or post-processed, impacts PPP convergence when used to constrain the solution. There are over 20 existing different IONEX postprocessed products and the choice of selection PPP ionospheric solution constraints in either dual- or triple-frequency multi-GNSS processing modes.},

We also propose a new, post-decomposition detection algorithm based on a new “inverse” Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) concept. The goal is to differentiate the spoofed and the authentic satellite signals to generate an authentic navigation solution. First, each satellite provides the two sets of signal parameters (code phases) post-decomposition. Using combinations of these sets, we calculate the pseudorange residuals and identify the two consistent (the authentic and spoofed) navigation solutions among all possible signal combinations over different times. The method is applicable to spoofing scenarios that can lead to Hazardous Misleading Information (HMI) and are difficult to detect by other means. The method can identify spoofing in the presence of multipath and when the spoofing signal power matches with offsets in code delay and Doppler frequency relatively close to the true signal.

The proposed technique leverages the antenna geometry to rabidly estimate the attitude parameters for various satellite combinations. Next, a dedicated decision-making algorithm is used to identify the satellite observations affected by multipath. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting the occurrence of multipath with high success rates. By rejecting the multipath-affected observations, we show remarkable performance gains when attitude determination is considered as an example application.},

The latter establishes a relationship between the orientation of the thigh INS and the kinematic motion of the leg. This relationship allows to observe the effect that the orientation errors have in the expected motion of the leg. We observe that the errors in the orientation estimation of an INS translate into incoherent human motion. Based on this analysis, we proposed a modified thigh INS to integrate biomechanical constraints. The results show that the proposed system outperforms the thigh INS in 50\% regarding distance error and 32\% regarding orientation error. Our approach allows us to improve the performance of INS using solely inertial measurements and biomechanical constraints. Additionally, it allows us to state that the performance of an INS can be improved by correcting the incoherent orientations.},

The proposed feature provides a combination of local and global description, incorporating their advantages while balancing their individual drawbacks. Planar primitives from both image and point clouds are detected for coarse recognition and selection of similar candidates, improving the independence of viewpoint and scenario similarity. Point descriptors, including scan context and SIFT, are then obtained for stage of fine recognition within the previous candidates. The results are evaluated using one real-world indoor dataset.

  abstract = {Automatic driving with coupled Global Navigation Satellite System/ Inertial Navigation System (GNSS/INS) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors have been widely developed for many years, and successfully implemented in many stable urban environments. However, current approaches are still prone to errors, especially in dynamic and challenging environments. Specifically, an urban environment with plenty of moving objects and various building layouts and materials will bring unexpected non-rigid and abnormal features for LiDAR systems and multi-path for GNSS signals, respectively. To address the challenges in challenging environments, especially in urban scenarios, we propose an innovative scheme, namely surround mask, that explores the error sources from surrounding environments and then improves the performance of the integrated mapping system. Rather than applying complex post-processing to eliminate the accumulated error for each observing unit, the surround mask extracts a two-layer factor including NLOS detection and static objects detection to collectively compensate for the specific drawbacks of the LiDAR-based SLAM and the navigation system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed surround mask can detect the represent the error sources in the local coordinate and provide environment-awareness information for the integrated mapping system.},

In this paper, we introduce a new concept of delivering the pseudorange correction calculated at the reference station on the lunar surface, as part of the LNSS navigation message. This allows LNSS users to take the advantage of differential positioning using pseudorange correction without adding new hardware to their receiver. The reference station proposed in this paper is equipped with instruments to externally estimate its own position relative to the lunar reference frame. The user on the lunar surface performs differential positioning using the station coordinate and pseudorange correction obtained at the reference station. Since the reference station coordinates are aligned to the lunar reference frame, the coordinate values of the user obtained by differential positioning are also aligned to the frame. In our simulation, we considered the satellite position error corresponding to the baseline length between the reference station and the user, the satellite position and clock offset error caused by the transmitting delay of pseudorange correction, the pseudorange noise and multi-pass at the reference station and user receiver respectively. The simulation results using eight ELFO satellites show that the RMS values for both horizontal and vertical positioning errors with differential correction are reduced to 1/10 of those without differential correction even at a distance of 10 degrees latitude from the reference station at the lunar south pole.},

It is important to recognize that certain relationships between sampling and code rates can result in an accuracy degradation. Although this aspect is understood within a select group within the receiver design community, this paper attempts to present and quantify the impact for a broader audience. Further, commercial vendors have continued to propose such architectures with a sampling frequency that is a multiple of the nominal code rate. This paper demonstrates the impact on the correlation function and pseudorange measurement using variations on the sampling frequency with real data.},

It highlights selected SDR implementations and achievements that are available to the public or influenced the general SDR development. The relation to the standardization process of Intermediate Frequency (IF) sample data and metadata is discussed, and a recent update of the Institute of Navigation (ION) SDR standard is recapitulated. The work focuses on GNSS SDR implementations on general purpose processors and leaves aside developments conducted on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) platforms. Data collection systems (i.e., front-ends) have always been of paramount importance for GNSS SDRs and are thus partly covered in this work. The work represents the knowledge of the authors but is not meant as a complete description of SDR history.

All the way from smart driving, robotics, surveillance, search and rescue missions, among many others. This is due to the availability of high-performance inexpensive cameras and the revolutionary advances in the accuracy and precision of different VO algorithms. One of the main issues designers of such algorithms confront is the tuning of different systems’ parameters as well as the testing and evaluation of their algorithms across a wide range of configurations. In this paper, a brief overview of different efforts exerted to solve this problem is given. This is followed by a detailed discussion of the need to design a generic extendable framework and a simulator for VO engines that take different design considerations into account. Consequently, the paper proposes a framework for testing, evaluating, and simulating conventional monocular VO engines in order to solve the two previously mentioned problems. The paper also discusses briefly different available options for extending the functionality of this framework to cover a wider range of VO engines and algorithms.},

OAKBAT contains digitized spoofing signals that serve as both a supporting “sibling,” and an advancement to the widely used Texas Spoofing Test Battery (TEXBAT) dataset [1]. OAKBAT at its core was developed to 1) allow for 100\% reproducibility of the data, 2) provide more detailed metadata and contextual information about each dataset such as the precise moment the spoofing and/or interference signals begins, positions used, constellations visible, etc., and 3) to provide datasets generated using the same key parameters as the TEXBAT ds1 through ds6 datasets. Through these “sibling” datasets it will now be possible to determine if the behavior of algorithms and designs developed utilizing these datasets are affected by possible intrinsic behavior and properties of the equipment used in the generation and digitization of either of the two datasets. The end goal of OAKBAT is to be a new resource for the community of researchers and developers working in the field of GNSS. This additional source of data provides a GNSS “playground” on which to experiment, explore, and evaluate new ideas.},

A considerable number of runners use these devices to get information about their performance. Current smart devices, which includes smartphones, tablets, smart watches, and smart glasses contain low cost motion sensors and positioning systems. Generally, the embedded smart devices sensors are considered insufficient for reliable navigation purposes due to high noise ratio and large random drift rates especially in scenarios where a portable device orientation can freely change with respect to the user body. Hence, there is a need for a navigation solution capable of accurately utilizing measurements from a portable device being carried or used by a runner at different running speeds and gaits without any constraints to move indoors or outdoors. Current consumer portable devices experience a variety of motions during running with common device use cases. Device use cases include; in arm band, on wrist, in pocket, in backpack, on chest, on belt, or on head just to name a few. The orientation of the portable device changes significantly which makes the sensor-based navigation very difficult if referenced to the user.},

  abstract = {A realized autonomous vehicle requires a ubiquitous, accurate, precise, and reliable localization system. Nowadays, the market is full of sensors that can be used for Positioning and Navigation; each with its strengths and weaknesses. Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) are usually used to build Inertial Navigation Systems (INS). INS can be accurate within short durations; however, INS accumulate errors and lose its accuracy very quickly, especially when using low-cost MEMS-based sensors. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) can provide an absolute position and velocity to update the INS over time. Barometer is used to provide an absolute height information, and odometer to provide speed update. Integrated navigation solution consisting of IMU, GNSS-RTK, and odometer can perform well in open sky areas and on highways. This system can achieve lane-level accuracy most of the time based on the sensors conditions and measurements quality. However, in downtown and urban environments, the degradation, multipath and blockage of the GNSS signal leads to poor performance for the integrated navigation system and is challenged to maintain lane level positioning. This paper presents a version of AUTO (formerly known as Coursa Drive), a real-time integrated navigation system that provides accurate, reliable, high rate, and continuous (always available) navigation solution for autonomous vehicles by integrating INS, RTK GNSS, odometer, and radar sensors with HD-Maps. AUTO performs a tight nonlinear integration of the radar and maps with the INS/GNSS/odometer system. The results presented in this paper demonstrates that radar measurements and HD-Maps can be tightly integrated with INS/GNSS in an effective manner such that the integrated system can provide a high rate, accurate, reliable, and robust navigation solution. This is a crucial requirement for realizing a fully autonomous vehicle that can operate in urban environments under a wide range of conditions, including adverse weather and lighting conditions, even in downtown with degraded/denied GNSS signals.},

Position accuracy using smoothed single-frequency pseudoranges is within 5 m, 3D residual-sum-of-squares (RSS), for the 22-hour duration with PDOP varying between 3-3.2. Further improvement in precision is shown by compensating multipath using sidereal repeatability but this process introduces a bias in the estimates. Velocity estimation accuracy using carrier phase measurements has 3D RSS mean and 1-sigma of 5.2 mm/s and 3.18 cm/s, respectively, which is better than the Doppler-derived estimates mean of 82.9 mm/s and 4.51 cm/s (1-sigma). We show better accuracy for both the position and velocity estimates as compared to the receiver’s estimates.},

  abstract = {MEMS inertial sensors (gyroscope and accelerometer) are widely used in many areas from automotive to space applications. Inertial sensors are critical components in navigation applications as they provide valuable measurements such as acceleration and rotation. The structure and material used in MEMS inertial sensors are affected from some environmental factors such as vibration, mechanical shock, humidity, electromagnetism, and temperature. The most restrictive environmental factor for MEMS inertial sensors is temperature. The characteristics of noise and deterministic errors change under different temperature conditions. Therefore, these drawbacks of temperature have to be degraded before using inertial sensors in navigation applications. Generally, calibration tests are performed under different temperature conditions to identify the behavior of deterministic errors in the operating temperature range. This process is time-consuming; hence, many IMU producers try to determine the minimum sufficient number of temperature conditions, which are used in the calibration tests. In this study, deterministic error parameters are estimated for two different temperature conditions in separate calibration processes. One of the calibration processes is performed at eleven different temperature points to determine temperature dependent behavior of the deterministic errors in the operating temperature range. Then, second calibration process is carried out at five different temperature points in the operating temperature. Moreover, calibration verification tests have been performed under three different temperature conditions to examine how deterministic error parameters are affected by decreasing temperature points from 11 to 5 points. 8 uncalibrated IMUs from same batch are taken into consideration and their deterministic error characteristics are investigated.},

  abstract = {Interference is a growing concern among GNSS users, particularly in parts of the world where radio frequency (RF) transmission is not strictly regulated. Intentional interference and jamming is cheap and relatively easy to obtain in the form of Personal Privacy Devices (PPD). These devices can sometime cause unintended interference and jamming to important infrastructure like an airport (Mitch, et al. 2013). This paper describes two methods for creating interference maps using NovAtel OEM7’s Interference Tool Kit (ITK). ITK can be used to measure the received interference power, which is more accurate and precise than other measurement types typically used for power difference of arrival: AGC (e.g. Blay and Akos, 2018, Borowski et al 2012, Thompson et al. 2011) and CNo (e.g. Strizic et al., 2018). Similar to the more common methods, when data is collected for an area around a static and continuously operating interference source, it can be used to map out the interference over the affected area. This paper extends the method of Alves, et al. (2018) with two additional and improved methods for mapping the interference and creating a likelihood map showing the position of the interferer. This paper includes three case studies with live (real-data) interference sources from India, Canada, and Japan.},

First the principle of this deterministic­statistical multipath simulator is reminded. A numerical validation of the electromagnetic multipath prediction is made by establishing the channel transfer function and comparing it to the one obtained with an electromagnetic software, FEKO, using the Method of Moments. To illustrate the outputs of such simulator, a comparison to measurements performed at ENAC is given. Then, after reminding the multipath pseudo­range error model that was established in [2], a multipath pseudo­range error model is adapted to ICAO code F airport layouts [3]. This model is based on the identification of canonical scenarios representing the taxi operation phase. The power spectral density of the multipath pseudo­range errors is over­bounded by a first order Gauss­Markov spectral density. An example of application for the taxi on stand taxilane sub­phase is proposed. In this example, the over­bounding distribution fits quite well the power spectral density of the estimated multipath pseudo­range errors.},

Several anti-jam techniques rely on the instantaneously narrowband signal characteristic and use joint-variable signal representations to reveal the jammer signature in the time-frequency (TF) domain. In this case, jammer excision becomes a two-step process, i.e., estimation of the TF signature or the IF of the jammer, and then removal of the jammer signal based on such estimate and with minimum distortion of the desired signal.},

  abstract = {The Global Positioning System (GPS) is the primary solution for outdoor navigation. However, the signals from these satellites are blocked in indoor environments leading to the need for alternative indoor solutions. The goal of this paper is to evaluate a new indoor navigation technique by incorporating floor plans along with monocular camera images into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a potential means for identifying camera position. Building floor plans are widely available and provide potential information for localizing within the building. This work sets out to determine if a CNN can learn the architectural features of a floor plan and use that information to determine a location. In this work, a simulated indoor data set is created and used to train two CNNs. A classification CNN, which breaks up the floor plan into 100 discrete bins and achieved 76.1\% top 5 accuracy on test data. Also, a regression CNN which achieved a distance error of 25.4 meters or less between the truth and predicted position on 80\% of the test data. The models are further improved by combining them with a filter solution.The best performing classification CNN is evaluated on real world data captured via TurtleBot 3, demonstrating the potential for this solution to be useful to real world Air Force indoor localization problems.},

This scheme appends two new message types (”MT”) to the SBAS scheduler without overburdening the SBAS message schedule. We take special care to make our scheme (1) meet appropriate security requirements to prevent and deter spoofing; (2) compatible with existing cryptographic standards; (3) flexible, expandable, and future proof to different cryptographic and implementation schemes; and (4) backward compatible with legacy receivers. The scheme accommodates a diverse set of features, including authenticating core-constellation ephemerides. The scheme requires loose time synchronization between the receiver and the provider, and we assert reasonable mitigation strategies to prevent attacks to that assumption. This work also discusses the SBAS provider and receiver machine state and startup, including aircraft that traverse differing SBAS coverage areas. We test our scheme with existing SBAS simulation and analysis tools to show negligible effects on SBAS availability and continuity requirements.},

  abstract = {Positioning with high precision and reliability can be provided by 5G cellular networks in environments where satellite positioning is not available or reliable. The accuracy that can be achieved by classical methods like triangulation and trilateration however degrades significantly under non line of sight (NLOS) conditions. The problem can be mitigated with increasingly dense deployments of network transmission and reception points (TRPs), but that is both impractical and costly. As an alternative, this study investigates if multipath propagation of radio signals can be exploited to improve positioning accuracy and reduce the necessary deployment density. With 3GPP Rel. 17 new signaling support has been introduced to report the propagation delay, corresponding to the length, of multiple paths between the user equipment (UE) and a network TRP. The length of a multipath can, in combination with a partially known map of the environment, give additional information about the UE position. In this study we develop multipath-assisted tracking algorithms and evaluate their performances in realistic simulations using 3GPP standardized positioning reference signals and measurements in an indoor factory environment. Our evaluations show that multipath-assisted algorithms can achieve an accuracy below 0.9 m in 90\% of the cases, which is more than tenfold better than a conventional LOS based algorithm. Moreover, one algorithm variant also shows an ability to track a UE using very few TRPs.},

In this FTR mode the gyro operates at low rates thus sacrificing the inherent high rate capability of the HRG.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the multipath error for modernized GNSS signals considering the: GNSS code and carrier signals; GNSS antenna characteristics; GNSS receiver architecture; and the installation configuration, including the reflecting boundary for a ground-based GNSS installation. The GNSS signals explicitly considered in this analysis are GPS L1 C/A, L5, L1Cp, BOC (10,5); Galileo ALTBOC, and the QZSS L6 signals. With the GNSS code and carrier multipath delay predictions at a fixed signal-to-multipath ratio using a coherent correlator architecture, the installed code and carrier multipath delay predictions are initially produced. Then multipath error predictions consider the two orthogonal GNSS antenna components, as modified by the complex reflection coefficient at the ground reflecting boundary modeled as wet soil. The multipath environment is modeled as a single specular ray, with due consideration to the polarization reversal at the Brewster angle from the reflecting boundary. The GNSS antenna will receive a composite signal that consists of the combination of the desired right-hand circularly polarized GNSS signal received above the horizon, and the undesired multipath signal that is predominantly left-hand polarized except when below the Brewster angle. Using these GNSS signal, receiver, antenna, receiver, installation, and reflection characteristics the final installed code and carrier multipath errors are predicted. Lastly, for a given GNSS installation that has a multipath limit that needs to be met, the antenna desired-to-undesired performance envelope limits are presented. These data will prove useful to GNSS site, antenna and receiver designers to illustrate the contributing factors in multipath error and what to expect if they sited their GNSS receiver and antenna systems in a particular configuration.},

  abstract = {Micro-electromechanical Systems (MEMS) inertial sensors are lightweight, small size and low-cost sensors that consume less power energy compared to their high-precision bulky counterparts. However, this miniaturization is a double-edged sword and MEMS-based inertial sensors suffer from various error sources, noises and instabilities. Indeed, inertial sensor errors vary with time, temperature and from turn on to turn on. In order to exploit the full potential of a MEMS-based inertial navigation system (INS), and to enhance its accuracy, it is indispensable to develop a temperature-dependent model that compensates these errors. Traditional temperature compensation methods rely on polynomial regression method, which fails to take into account the nonlinearities inherent in the sensor errors. This paper proposes a new temperature compensation model for a full inertial measurement unit (IMU), based on a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) that compensates the significant deterministic errors of both accelerometer and gyroscope triads in a wide temperature range. A high precision rate table and a thermal chamber are used for accurate testing. The effectiveness of the method is investigated with various static and dynamics tests in the laboratory and with a car, and results are compared with the traditional polynomial fitting method.},

However, in order to achieve accurate positioning with LTE signals, the transmitter location and clock state information is required, which is not provided by the system. This paper presents the estimation of the LTE transmitter position and clock states by using the LTE Secondary Synchronization Signals (SSS) and Cell-specific Reference Signal (CRS). Herewith, an analysis of the LTE SSS and CRS signals is done at a theoretical level to identify performance limitations when employed as 10 ms-long local replica in a GNSS-like processing and a comparison of transmitter localization results, obtained using these signals, is presented. Receiver optimizations for LTE signal compatibility are discussed within the context of extending the Multi-Sensor Analysis Tool (MuSNAT) software receiver for LTE SSS and CRS acquistion and tracking. The complete processing chain, which is based on MuSNAT and a MATLAB based LTE transmitter localization filter, has been validated based on simulation and is then employed for two commercial base stations and a research purposed Amarisoft LTE/5G base station.},

  abstract = {The scope of the paper is to provide a generic receiver architecture that can cope with future Navigation Message Authentication (NMA) and Spreading Code Authentication (SCA) for the open service (OS) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals. The authentication proposals can be divided in those that suggest the encryption of the navigation data, those that suggest encryption of the spreading code, and those that suggest combining both encryptions. However, on the receiver side, the mere implementation of such algorithms is not enough to identify a spoofing attack, and therefore, further receiver capabilities need to be considered when defining a GNSS signal authentication receiver architecture.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an enhancement of the well-known GNSS/INS sensor fusion approach by supporting cooperative distance measurements to improve its positioning performance for terrestrial vehicle navigation. The areas of improvement are those where the GNSS signals are severely degraded and the low-cost INS system can not provide reliable dead reckoning position estimations. In the proposed cooperative positioning scheme, additional information is acquired from other infrastructure or communication network, such as adhoc sensor network with several intercommunicated vehicles or nodes. The additional information provided mainly by distance measurements between nodes and from nodes to other elements of the network (e.g. anchor nodes placed on fixed equipment such as traffic lights) can be used as independent measurements reporting new information to the Bayesian filter. The implementation has been tested in a representative field test by deploying a network of commercial off-the-shelf Ultra Wide Band (UWB) anchor nodes, which can provide down to centimeter distance measurement accuracy. Results show an improvement of the positioning performance in challenging scenarios where the original GNSS/INS fusion did not meet ITS positioning requirements due to the GNSS signal impairments and the lack of stability of low-cost IMUs.},

This requires a great level of flexibility in systems design and architecture such that any change in requirements can be handled with minimum time and efforts. At the same time, modern navigation and positioning systems require high degree of smartness and context awareness such that the navigation systems automatically reconfigure themselves to adapt to the current environment. In this context, this paper describes the architecture and framework of an ongoing development of a smart reconfigurable multi-sensor integrated navigation and positioning system. The proposed design and framework are based on object oriented design concepts and address key challenges in multi-sensors navigation systems, such as, hardware abstraction, sensors data abstraction, filter encapsulation, multi-filtering, multi-threading, synchronization, interoperability with external sources, integrity monitoring, and multiple navigation states evolution scenarios. By introducing this design and framework, the paper also tries to draw potential standards and guidelines for engineers involved in multi-sensors integrated navigation and positioning systems design and development.},

Hence, micro air vehicles (MAVs) are becoming more and more attractive due to their flexibility in terms of the place of use and their perception abilities using various sensors. Thus, this paper deals with data processing of particularly a 2D laser rangefinder and a monocular camera in order to reconstruct the explored indoor environment. It is presented how to overcome sparse laser depth information by using additionally camera images. In order to achieve this goal, the generated point cloud is segmented such that local 3D models are found. This makes it possible to reconstruct lines in world frame, which yields further improvement of the geometric representation. Besides that, the found 3D models are enriched with color information by calculating the homography matrix. The results in indoor environment comprising corridor and office show an accurate geometric and chromatic reconstruction. This enables task planners to quickly interpret and coordinate the ongoing situation.},

For this purpose, a test bench is created and two multipath models are used. The first one is the fixed-offset model. It is a straight-forward implementation which allows to study the behaviour of the receiver regarding a constant error case. The second model is deterministic-stochastic and it is based on an existing one which is further developed. A deterministic model is appropriate when the system is well-known, whereas a stochastic one describes the uncertainties. Thus, for a multipath environment the mixture of these two leads to a result which is closer to reality. Within this paper, the deterministic part allows the environment modeling and the statistical one models the random scattering.},

To the best of our knowledge, FrFT is used for the first time in GNSS domain as an interference cancellation method. Both methods use blanking as an excision method in the transform domain.

  abstract = {The task of inertial sensor calibration has always been challenging, especially when dealing with stochastic errors that remain after the deterministic errors have been filtered out. Among others, the number of observations is becoming increasingly high since sensor measurements are taken at high frequencies over longer periods of time, thereby placing considerable limitations on the estimation of the complex models that characterize stochastic errors (without considering testing and selection procedures). Moreover, before estimating these models, there is a need for tests that determine whether the error signals are characterized by a model that remains constant over time and, if so, which model best predicts these errors. Considering these needs, this paper presents an open-source software platform that allows practitioners to carry out these procedures by making use of two recent proposals which stem from the Generalized Method of Wavelet Moments framework. These proposals make use of the growing amount of signal replicates issued during sensor calibration procedures and the proposed platform allows users to easily employ various functions that implement these methods in a user-friendly and computationally efficient manner.},

  abstract = {In recent years, we have witnessed a rapid increase in the number of applications of Global Navigation Satellite Systems, which have become the primary source for high-precision positioning and accurate timing. This trend led to two main effects: a strengthening of the performance requirements and an increase in the attempts of altering the estimation of the user’s position and timing information. To address both issues, in this paper we propose a context-based framework for enhancing the reliability, integrity, and availability of satellite-based positioning systems. It exploits the joint processing of information related to both local and distributed contexts. The distributed context represents the information that can be collected from a set of spatially distributed information sources. The local context, on the other hand, accounts for the environment surrounding the monitored system. In this work, the proposed framework is detailed and a proof-of-concept experimental validation is presented.},

  abstract = {The high relevance of GNSS for positioning and timing in different applications increase the risk of (intended or unintended) radio interference (e.g. jamming or spoofing). One of the most sophisticated and efficient countermeasure against this threat is an antenna array, which can utilize a spatial filter to mitigate malevolent signals (e.g. by placing a spatial null in the direction of these signals). Using an antenna array together with carrier phase positioning (used for highly accurate and precise positioning like RTK or PPP) requires extra care, because the spatial filtering manipulates the incoming phase of the different antenna elements in order to form the interference free signal. In this paper we will propose and compare two different approaches to mitigate interference and simultaneously maintain a consistent carrier phase measurement. The first approach does not need any preliminary information about the antenna array (blind approach), while the second approach explicitly requires such information (deterministic approach). These approaches will be tested in two different real-world scenarios including a low and a high dynamic jamming scenario. The results show that both approaches are valuable in different situations. However, the deterministic approach performs better in a matter of accuracy and precision even with unprecise knowledge about the antenna pattern.},

At the same time the risk of radio-frequency interference(RFI), intentional or unintentional, increases. A promising countermeasure is to suppress the interference in the spatial domain using an antenna array. To apply this technique, a weighting vector is calculated and regularly updated during operation. This weighting vector is applied to the input signals resulting in a single output signal, which can drive a common GNSS receiver. However, these weighting vectors vary in time to adapt to the direction of arrival (DoA) of the satellites and the RFI. Therefore, this technique may induce a phase error to the carrier phase measurements. The carrier phase measurements are obligatory for high precision approaches like Precise Point Positioning (PPP) or Real Time Kinematics (RTK). In this work two new approaches reducing the phase error induced by spatial signal processing are introduced. The first approach aims to steer the phase of an updated weighting vector based on the previous weighting vector and the second approach aims to steer the phase of an updated weighting vector based on a constant weighting vector for all satellites.},

One major risk to the position estimation is the so called spoofing threat. A spoofer fakes satellite signals in order to mislead a GNSS receiver into estimating a wrong user position. A lot of research focuses on the detection and mitigation of spoofing by evaluating several metrics implemented in the receiver. However, beforehand it should be investigated under which conditions a receiver is affected by spoofing. In this work a simulation tool is described to simulate a scenario, where a receiver structure processes a signal containing an authentic and a spoofing signal. The parameters of the spoofing signal are variated. These simulations are repeated with different receiver settings in order to evaluate robust configurations for GNSS receivers. The results show that especially the coherent integration time in the receiver’s tracking loops has a large impact on the vulnerability of the receiver.},

  abstract = {The current Advanced Reciever Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (ARAIM) airborne user algorithm [1] takes a simple approach to modelling the integrity risk, i.e., the specific risk of loss of integrity for a given approach is allocated to each epoch so that the user receiver can derive its protection level. This paper aims to investigate the impact of the temporal correlation of ARAIM fault detection tests and position errors on the probability of hazardous misleading information (PHMI) by deriving the valid number of samples. A methodology is presented to estimate the actual PHMI over a given time interval. Probabilities that test statistics and position errors respectively cross the corresponding test threshold and protection bound over the duration are modelled based on the instant satellite reinclusion approach. A distribution of a normalised random variable the maximum of the standardised first order Gauss-Markov (GM) process during the interval. For the distribution, 108 sample functions of the GM process are generated with a correlation function taking account for all GNSS measurement error sources. We also estimate the likelihood that the no detection and positioning failure conditions co-occur. An upper bound of the actual PHMI over the time is derived by combining those three probabilities, and the valid number of independent samples is identified by comparing the upper bound to the integrity risk allocated to a single epoch. A case study is shown to lead to effective samples of more than 1700 when the temporal correlation effect is considered. It is also found that full capacity of 99.5\% availability could no longer be achieved for H-ARAIM RNP 0.1 operation and the 99.5\% V-ARAIM availability for LPV-200 is reduced by approximately 6\% when the actual risk allocation through the effective number of samples is applied to the protection level calculation.},

For this purpose, we present a multiple hypothesis-based approach to test the integrity performance of the GPS/GLONASS RAIM and the corresponding integrity bound against multiple failures. We compute the probability of missed detection (PMD) under each failure, and we compare this PMD to the requirement for single failure (i.e., 10-4), as in lines with the proposed MOPS test method. We also compute total probability of hazardous misleading information (PHMI) by accounting for all possible fault hypothesis and compare it with the integrity risk requirement of 10-7. In a preliminary assessment, it is shown that the maximum PMD for a pair of faults is approximately 10-7 and the maximum PHMI for multiple satellite failures goes up to approximately 2ή10-8 when the proposed method is applied. Also, this paper evaluates the integrity monitoring test procedures outlined by GPS/GLONASS MOPS based on those performance analyses.},

Furthermore, from 2016 GNSS raw measurements are made available to developers on Android smartphones. For these reasons, and considering that smartphones have access to the Internet, it is plausible to aim at implement decimeter-level positioning techniques on these devices. Nonetheless, smartphones also have some flaws when using them as GNSS receivers. Firstly, the GNSS antenna and the rest of the electronics are embedded inside the body of the smartphone. This causes the signals to be received at a low signal-to-noise ratio and can cause small interference that further degrade the received signal. Secondly, smartphone manufacturers usually put low-cost GNSS chips in their smartphones since the manufacturing cost of the device comprises many more components. Therefore, the quality of the hardware cannot be compared to that of the high-end GNSS receivers that are commonly used for high-accuracy positioning applications.},

  abstract = {The availability of raw observations from smartphones and tablets brings new challenges to GNSS data processing. Low-cost GNSS chipsets, combined with omnidirectional antennas, can lead to measurements highly contaminated by noise and multipath. Therefore, data quality depends not only on the device but also on the environment. Such a diversity is complex to handle for automated GNSS data processing services such as the NRCan precise point positioning (PPP) service. Processing strategies developed for geodetic receivers now require adaptations to be suitable for low-cost devices: 1) carrier-to-noise weighting should replace elevation-dependent weighting; 2) precise ionospheric corrections with meaningful quality indicators should be available; 3) the residual tropospheric zenith delay parameter should not be estimated in the PPP filter, which calls for more accurate a priori tropospheric models; and 4) quality control algorithms should rely on geometry-based rather than geometry-free approaches. With such modifications, static PPP solutions using data collected with a Huawei Mate 20X smartphone can converge to cm-level accuracies under favorable signal tracking conditions.},

The user range error can be significantly improved using precise satellite orbit and clock corrections, as well as atmospheric delay predictions. This paper focuses on the process of generating corrections for the signal delay/advance caused by the ionosphere. We analyze the impact of three variables on the accuracy of these corrections: the input slant ionospheric delays, the mathematical model, and the network configuration. When the input delays are derived from the precise point positioning (PPP) methodology, we show that ambiguity resolution (PPP-AR) offers a 20-50\% reduction in the RMS error of predicted delays over float ambiguity estimates. Among the models evaluated, the dual-layer and conical models can reduce RMS errors by more than 50\% over the single-layer model during moderate ionospheric activity. Finally, for the days analyzed, increasing inter-station distances from 75 km to 150 km only deteriorates RMS errors by 10\%.},

  abstract = {A key aspect of robotics today is estimating the state, such as position and orientation, of a robot as it moves through the world. Most robots and autonomous vehicles depend on noisy data from sensors such as cameras or laser rangefinders to navigate in a three-dimensional world. This book presents common sensor models and practical advice on how to carry out state estimation for rotations and other state variables. It covers both classical state estimation methods such as the Kalman filter, as well as important modern topics such as batch estimation, the Bayes filter, sigmapoint and particle filters, robust estimation for outlier rejection, and continuous-time trajectory estimation and its connection to Gaussian-process regression. The methods are demonstrated in the context of important applications such as point-cloud alignment, pose-graph relaxation, bundle adjustment, and simultaneous localization and mapping. Students and practitioners of robotics alike will find this a valuable resource.},

The user then adds these corrections onto their measured pseudoranges before implementing a position solution algorithm.

  abstract = {The poor signal visibility and continuity associated with urban environments together with the slow convergence/reconvergence time of Precise Point Positioning (PPP), usually makes PPP unsuitable for land navigation in cities. However, results based on simulated open areas demonstrated that, once Galileo reaches final operational capability, PPP convergence time will be cut in a half using dual-constellation GPS/Galileo observations. Therefore, it might be possible to extend the applicability of PPP to land navigation in certain urban areas. Preliminary results, based on simulations, showed that GPS/Galileo PPP is possible where buildings are relatively short and satellites minimum visibility requirement is met for most of the time. In urban environments, signal discontinuity and reconvergence still represent the major problem for traditional PPP, which is based on the ionosphere-free combination of twofrequency pseudo-range and carrier phase. An alternative method to mitigate the ionosphere delay is proposed in order to ensure the best positioning performance from multi-frequency PPP. Instead of using the ionosphere-free combination, here low noise dual- or triple-frequency pseudo-range combinations are corrected with ionosphere delay information coming from federated carrier smoothing (Hatch) iono-estimation filters for each satellite. This method provides faster re-convergence time and ensures the best possible positioning performance from the Galileo Alternative BOC modulation in multi-frequency PPP. Indeed, even though Galileo E5 has small tracking noise and excellent multipath rejection, its PPP positioning performance is limited by the influence of E1 signal errors in the ionosphere-free combination, degrading the quality of the measurements.},

  abstract = {Multi-frequency signals, broadcast by the next generation GNSS satellites, have led to the development of the Triple Carrier Ambiguity Resolution method. This method, which is based on the “gap-bridging” concept, is an extraordinarily simple approach that allows quick ambiguity resolution. Due to large ionospheric delays, Triple Carrier Ambiguity Resolution was originally developed for and applied only to double difference measurement processing in Real Time Kinematic (RTK) systems. In recent years Precise Point Positioning (PPP) has become an attractive solution for high accuracy positioning in remote areas where, for logistics or economic reasons, cannot have any nearby reference station. Unfortunately, PPP’s long convergence time (typically 20 minutes) limits the scientific and commercial applications for PPP to only open sky conditions. For this reason, an instantaneous ambiguity fixing methods such as Triple Carrier Ambiguity Resolution could represent an extraordinary asset for PPP. This paper presents an implementation of the Triple Carrier Ambiguity Resolution that makes use of a smoothed ionosphere correction to mitigate for the ionospheric delay in the pseudorange measurements and, therefore, it can be used with undifferenced observations as in case of PPP. From the statistical point of view, reliable ambiguity fix can be achieved in less than 30 seconds in a multipath-free environment, while in presence of severe multipath the narrow lane ambiguity can be fixed after 10 minutes. Results based on simulated data showed that the time required to fix the narrow lane ambiguity, with measurements affected by multipath, was much larger than the one promised by the theoretical statistical analysis. It confirmed what stated by other authors, that triple carrier ambiguity resolution works well only in absence of multipath. Finally, this paper also analyzes the positioning performance of a PPP configuration in which the narrow lane ambiguity is kept float, while the extra-wide and wide lane ambiguities are fixed. In this configuration, a triple-frequency ionosphere-free carrier phase combination, characterized by a large narrow lane wavelength, is used together with the two frequency pseudorange and carrier phase ionosphere-free combinations. Results based on simulated data show that the horizontal error converges below 10 cm in less than 3 minutes and below 5 cm in less than 10 minutes.},

  abstract = {The road sector is the most dynamic and growing field for GNSS applications, far beyond vehicle navigation. Since navigation signals are received at a power level some magnitude below the thermal noise floor, they can easily be obscured by interference signals. In order to give operators of commercial and financial critical applications, requiring high integrity, the means to act on detected interference events, it is envisaged for the next development step to make information on the interference environment available to service providers and exchange information among them. In this paper, we evaluate sensors and extensions of standards, from the road transportation sector that are used for exchange of traffic related information, to support also interference data exchange. To develop standards for systems of road traffic engineering, the initiative “OCIT© - Open Communication Interface for Road Traffic Control Systems” was founded by the companies SIEMENS, Swarco Traffic Systems, AVT Stoye and Stührenberg. To exchange sensor data among road users, ITS standards are currently under development at ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute). With the focus on these standards, extensions to enable an interference data exchange service are proposed.},

The OSPA metric is often used for measuring the distance between two sets of points in Euclidean space. A common example is in multi-target filtering, where the aim is to estimate the set of current target states, all of which have the same dimension. In multi-target tracking (MTT), the aim is to estimate the set of target tracks over a period of time, rather than the set of target states at each time step. In this case, it is not sufficient to analyse the multi-target filtering error at each time step in isolation. It is important that a metric for evaluating MTT performance accounts for the dissimilarity between the overall target tracks, which are generally of different dimensions. In this paper, we demonstrate that MTT error can be captured using the OSPA metric to define a distance between two sets of tracks.},

This work presents a feasibility study examining the expected performance of a navigation algorithm relying on cellular signals of opportunity. The problem is posed as a simultaneous localization and mapping problem, since the states of the cellular signals must be jointly estimated with the user’s position and velocity. This work explores how much information about the position and clock bias states of the cellular signals in order to make a useful navigation system. An analysis method for determining the steady-state covariance is also derived by assuming that the system is periodic. Simulated results show that in a typical route with reasonable assumptions, a position RMSE of 12 m might be obtained. This study shows that cellular signals of opportunity are a feasible option for long-duration navigation, especially if the route can be flown more than once to obtain better estimates of cellular site positions.},

  abstract = {Current global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) form and transmit navigation signals utilizing intermodulation (IM) products in their multiplexing schemes to enable the operation of the satellite’s high power amplifier (HPA) with a constant envelope input. Feeding a constant envelope signal into an HPA allows for an efficient operation close to its saturation point minimizing the output power backoff (OBO) while additionally minimizing phase distortions. However, IM products applied in the context of satellite navigation can be regarded as a waste of scarce satellite power. IM products are transmitted within the composite navigation signal, but neither provide ranging possibilities nor convey navigation data while restricting the available transmit power of signal components usable for navigation. Increasing the transmit power of usable signal components would be desirable as better ranging performance is achieved. Omitting IM products to a certain extent might be one way to enable GNSS satellites to form usable signal components with increased power but might lead to increased OBO losses and distortions arising at the HPA. Hence, we investigate in this paper the trade-off between increased usable signal power and amplifier efficiency when varying the portion of IM products in existing composite satellite navigation signals. We evaluate the performance by optimizing achievable receiver efficiency and then time of arrival (TOA) estimation error standard deviation. The results suggest that the scalable Interplex methodology is in most cases able to increase the ranging performance of each signal component.},

Ad-hoc mobile networks offer a decentralized alternative, so this paper addresses the challenge of incorporating a ranging capacity to an existing ad-hoc digital communications system. However, signal protocols and signal processing chains that are optimised for efficient communications do not easily support the precise timing that is required for accurate range measurements. For this system, there is the further challenge that it uses narrow bandwidth signals in the 10 − 20kHz range. For perspective, each data symbol is 2-3 orders of magnitude larger than a chip of a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal. Therefore, signal timing measurements must be accurate to a tiny fraction of a symbol if a useful positioning capability is to be achieved.},

After getting promising results from experimental results (i.e. precise and accurate detection of movement from cm to mm level), in 2017 and 2018 NSL have deployed several networks of STICK units throughout the United Kingdom. A particularly interesting case study started in October 2017 with a GNSS network monitoring of 15 STICK devices being deployed in an area surrounding a section of rail track on the West Highland Line in Scotland. Current positions are 1-2cm accurate and automatically obtained server-side following the Real Time Kinematic technique. However, the actual displacement is usually smaller than or comparable to the precision of the measurements. Hence, statistical strategies, including bootstrapping, are adopted to analyze the GNSS processing results for the evaluation of the presence of movement with a certain level confidence. For the case study discussed here, the analysis of the stochastic processes produces trend lines representing movement at the 1mm level.},

To extend the capability of GNSS in difficult environment, a tight coupling between GNSS-RTK and an inertial navigation systems can greatly improve the results. This solution is adapted to small GNSS outage under bridges and in urban canyon for automotive survey for instance. If the time spent in GNSS outage is too long or if the kinematic of the survey is too weak, the GNSS inertial solution can be compromised, due to high navigation errors, and ultimately, impossibility to align heading angle at initialization. This occurs most often for pedestrian survey where the GNSS conditions are worst and dynamics are low. Some solutions on the market propose a LIDAR based SLAM to overcome the limitations of INS/GNSS. However this solution has a great impact on the mapping solution in terms of bill of materials costs, and power consumption. Indeed, two LIDARs are generally used in this case : one dedicated to SLAM and one dedicated to point cloud generation.},

  abstract = {Generating magnetic anomaly maps for use with MagNav (magnetic anomaly navigation) is a challenging problem. Current aeromagnetic survey design requirements, procedures, and processing software are often proprietary and specifically designed for geological interpretation. This article introduces a detailed aeromagnetic anomaly survey process and open-source Python software library to easily generate a MagNav map based on a single, given survey. This process and software library was used for generating maps of four overlapping surveys at Camp Atterbury (Edinburgh, Indiana). We used a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) modified for magnetic surveyance and local ground magnetic reference station for these surveys. The correlation between the overlapping portions of the final survey maps were then calculated and analyzed to evaluate map accuracy and repeatability. Across the four surveys measured and processed, two surveys were well made-made and repeatable with correlation coefficients up to 0.81. One survey suffered from aircraft calibration issues. Additionally, we developed a novel method to estimate local magnetic temporal variations. This method may remove the need for a local magnetic reference station during aeromagnetic surveys. Using this method, extended reference station modeling (ERSM), we show that temporal variations in the local magnetic field can be estimated accurately using a magnetic observatory up to 2400 km away. Testing the ERSM method with data from International Real-time Magnetic Observatory Network (INTERMAGNET) magnetic observatories resulted in root mean square errors (RMSE) and error standard deviations as small as 3.64 nT and 3.24 nT, respectively, when estimating local temporal variations.},

This positioning key issue exists not only in terms of accuracy, but also in terms of integrity. Actually, one aims at reducing as much as possible the error mainly due to multipath on buildings, and provide in the mean time a certain guarantee on the user position exactness. This communication shows how a simple geometrical modeling, named “Urban Trench”, of the city environment can improve significantly the positioning accuracy. Authors also propose an algorithm for computing in this context an urban trench protection level, with a much higher reliability compared to standard protection level whose open sky assumption is violated. Preliminary results are given in the city of Nantes, France. One of the most interesting feature of the model is that it complies with the existing digital road map features and does not cause data storage or computational throughput problems.},

While requiring known measurement error bounds in only non-spoofed conditions, we design a two-tier approach: We first perform measurement-level spoofing mitigation via deviation of measurement innovation from its expected p-Zonotope, and second perform state-level timing risk analysis via intersection probability of estimated pZonotope with an unsafe set that violates IEEE C37.118.1a-2014 standards. We validate the proposed SR-DKF by subjecting a simulated receiver network to coordinated signal-level spoofing. We demonstrate an improved GPS timing accuracy and successful spoofing mitigation via our SR-DKF. We validate the robustness of the estimated timing risk as the number of receivers are varied.},

Given the known measurement error bounds in non-faulty conditions, our ILA follows a unified approach to address multiple measurement faults and works with any off-the-shelf estimator. We analyze measurement deviation to estimate the stochastic reachable set of expected position for each landmark, which is parameterized via probabilistic zonotope (p-Zonotope). We apply set union to formulate a pZonotopic cost that represents the size of position bounds based on landmark inclusion or exclusion. We jointly minimize the p-Zonotopic cost and maximize the number of landmarks via convex relaxation.

We conceptualize the design of a SmallSat-based LNCSS with Earth-GPS time-transfer that provides navigation and communication services near the lunar South Pole. In particular, we formulate a hybrid constellation design, wherein all satellites are equipped to provide navigation services while only a fraction among them are communication-enabled. Using the Systems Tool Kit (STK) simulation software, we examine various LNCSS constellation case studies based in elliptical lunar frozen orbit (ELFO) and with a lower-grade chip-scale atomic clock (CSAC). We evaluate case studies in terms of (1) navigation design considerations, including position and timing accuracy, lunar user equivalent ranging error, dilution of precision; (2) communication design considerations, including daily data volume, availability, data rate; and (3) SmallSat factors, including the cost, size, weight and power of the satellite payload.

A set-valued representation enables robustness by ensuring that a continuum of possible positions obeys safety constraints; such sets can also be used as inputs for robust estimators. Unfortunately, most urban localization methods return point-valued estimates which do not accurately model the position distribution. One strategy with the potential for set-valued estimation is Shadow Matching (SM), where one uses a 3-D map to compute GNSS shadows (where line-of-sight is blocked). However, SM requires a point-valued grid for computational tractability, with accuracy limited by grid resolution.},

We perform graph optimization using the sequential data of GPS pseudoranges, pixel intensities, vehicle dynamics and satellite ephemeris to simultaneously localize the vehicle as well as the landmarks, namely GPS satellites and key image pixels in the world frame. We estimate the fault mode vector by analyzing the temporal correlation across the GPS measurement residuals and spatial correlation across the vision intensity residuals. In particular, to detect and isolate the vision faults, we developed a superpixel-based piecewise Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) technique to perform spatial voting across image pixels. For an estimated fault mode, we compute the protection levels by applying worst-case failure slope analysis to the linearized Graph-SLAM framework.},

Global Positioning System (GPS) have been the prominent technology to fulfill this demanding requirement for reliable navigation over extended periods of time, covering any part of the world during day or night. However, in a number of scenarios, standalone GPS measurements may be completely unreliable (like in canyons or forests) due to the signal blockages or multipath effects etc (in urban areas). Under these circumstances, alternative information sources, like Inertial Navigation System (INS), need to be employed to bridge the gap of times when GPS signal reception is unavailable. In this paper we implement a novel hybrid methodology based on Dempster Shafer theory (DS) augmented by Support Vector Machine (SVM) to integrate INS and GPS measurements; thereby enhancing the accuracy of the low-cost Micro-Electro-MechanicalSystems (MEMS) based navigation system.},

  abstract = {Advanced RAIM (ARAIM) for vertical guidance has attracted considerable attention both from integrity providers and receiver manufacturers, due to its potential to achieve worldwide coverage of vertical guidance with a reduced investment on the ground segment compared to Space-based Augmentation Systems. Several user algorithms have been published, mostly variants of solution separation and possible optimizations. These descriptions have mostly focused on the definition of the Vertical Protection Level (VPL), because that is what was needed to simulate ARAIM availability as a function of different parameters and constellation configurations. However, an ARAIM user algorithm has many more elements that need to be defined. The purpose of this work is to describe an Advanced RAIM user algorithm step-by-step including: the Integrity Support Message (ISM) processing, the fault detection and exclusion, and the Protection Level calculation – including the Horizontal Protection Level. In this description, we attempt to clarify areas that have remained undefined.},

In this work, we use the properties of the power spectral density to develop error models that bound autoregressive models with uncertain parameters.

  abstract = {The largest source of error uncertainty in current Space-based Augmentation Systems, which are single frequency (L1), is the ionospheric delay. In the coming years, the deployment of new signals in L5 will allow civil users to estimate and remove the ionospheric delay in the pseudoranges. This will have a large impact on the planned dual frequency Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS). Once the ionospheric delay error uncertainty is removed, the Protection Levels will decrease substantially, and other error sources will dominate. The remaining terms in the error bound are much less critical than the ionospheric delay error bound in the current single system, so it is likely that they can still be optimized. This is true in particular for the User Differential Range Error (UDRE) and Message Type 28 (MT28) algorithms which compute the clock and ephemeris error bounds. In [1], we outlined the main elements of a covariance based joint UDRE and MT28, which took into account both biases and receiver faults. Simulations showed that it could reduce VPLs by 20\%, potentially enabling more demanding operations like Cat. II approaches. The improvements did not depend on a change in the message standards. In [2], we showed that this algorithm could even bring benefits to the current single frequency Wide Area Augmentation System WAAS, by making coverage less sensitive to the loss of a single satellite, and by strengthening coverage on the coasts of the U.S.},

However, with large probabilities, the user receiver needs to protect against a large number of fault modes (which results from the combination of simultaneous independent faults). In baseline ARAIM algorithms, the user receiver must compute a fault tolerant position solution for each fault mode (computed using the subset of the available measurements that would not be affected by the fault mode), or at least its error covariance. After showing how to use a solution separation algorithm without computing the fault tolerant position solutions, we present a technique to obtain upper bounds on the subset error covariance for a given subset size. This upper bound does not require the computation of every subset error covariance, and can be computed without additional matrix inversions. We evaluate the potential of this technique by examining a specific satellite geometry.},

With the current GPS constellation, WAAS has very high availability, and is even robust to some degradation in the constellation. However, even with the current GPS constellation, WAAS availability can be affected by the loss of a single satellite. In addition, there is growing interest in using WAAS for more demanding operations, such as Autoland. For these reasons, it is worthwhile investigating possible improvements in the ground monitors (which would not require avionics updates).},

  abstract = {There are several techniques that deal with multipath mitigation either on the observation level, i.e. satellite pseudorange and carrier-phase, or directly during the tracking process of the signals within a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver. One of these techniques is Synthetic Aperture Processing (SAP) [1] or ”Supercorrelation” [2] which takes the advantage from using a longer coherent integration time, up to couple of seconds, or equivalently very low Phase Locked Loop (PLL) bandwidths. This effectively realizes a Synthetic Antenna Aperture (SAA) being proportional to the inverse of the PLL bandwidth multiplied by the velocity of the antenna. Large SAAs mitigate multipath well and thus the bandwidth of carrier-phase tracking loops should be decreased, e.g. down to 0.1 Hz or lower. This requires removal of Line of Sight (LOS) dynamics from the PLL via inertial aiding and additionally, proper tracking of the oscillator jitter by all tracking channels, so-called Cooperative Tracking Loops (Co-Op). Within an innovative research oriented MATLAB based GPS/Galileo L1/E1/L5/E5a receiver, this will be demonstrated in this paper with real satellite signals. Real Time Kinematics (RTK) processing of the produced GNSS observations demonstrates the high accuracy of this signal processing method.},

The essential matrix encodes the up-to-scale geometric relationship between two camera poses and contains the relative rotation and direction-of-translation between them. A dense network of up-to-scale relative pose measurements is constructed by computing essential matrices between incoming images and a collection of past states which observed the same scene. As the essential matrix is computed online in many visual-inertial navigation systems (VINS) as part of the image processing front end, the proposed method introduces little computational overhead while avoiding all computations related to feature estimation. This approach can be viewed as a modification of the classical pose-graph simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. This paper further presents a dynamic initialization method to bootstrap the velocity, orientation, and biases of an IMU. The initialization method makes use of the same modified pose-graph SLAM approach to solve for the up-to-scale relative poses of a window of camera frames before solving for orientation, velocity, and sensor biases. We validate the proposed methods by implementing them in Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and nonlinear optimization forms and testing them on public datasets.},

  abstract = {The fusion of a camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is a rapidly-growing approach to GPS-denied navigation due to its minimal size, weight, and power requirements. In order to become a standard approach to for robust GPS-denied navigation, visual-inertial estimation must be able to perform in all situations, especially those present in challenging environments. Despite the popularity and wide-reaching applicability of the field, most visual-inertial research has focused on a standard platform and problem of a small aerial vehicle equipped with a machine-vision camera and inexpensive IMU operating in a well-lit indoor environment. As a result, the literature on extending visual-inertial estimation to illumination-challenged environments such as poorly-lit indoor scenarios and nighttime outdoor scenarios is shallow. These situations present significant challenges to visual navigation systems as their lack of contrast and illumination results in a reduced ability to extract and match features, therefore reducing the availability of valid visual measurements. To enable operation in such challenging situations, this paper presents a visual-inertial estimator which successfully operates with a visual-spectrum camera in poorly-lit environments and a thermalinfrared camera in illumination-denied environments. This success is achieved by a modification of the standard visual feature extraction and matching process which improves the robustness of features to contrast and illumination changes. After matching and processing such features, further robustness and accuracy improvements are achieved by the implementation of a dual-layer estimator which employs a robust and efficient EKF-based frontend to preprocess and validate incoming measurements before passing them into a batch least-squares optimizing backend. Solutions from the backend are periodically fed back into the frontend to correct accumulated error and maintain accurate real-time state estimates.},

  abstract = {Availability of new GPS civil signals L2C and L5 along with existed L1C/A signal and Galileo E1/E5/E6 signals has increased the potential ways to generate linear combination of signals to remove ionosphere errors and improve accuracy in carrier integer ambiguity resolution. Conventionally, a linear combination of dual frequency signals has been used to remove first order ionosphere delays incurred in signal propagation path which is a major source of range error. Out of the three civil signals in GPS and Galileo system, L5/E5 signals have advanced signal features such as higher received power, faster chip rate and lower carrier frequency than L1/E1 and L2C/E6 signals. Hence, dual frequency receiver with combination of L1/L5 and E1/E5 signals is more suitable to remove ionosphere delay and get benefit from L5/E5 signal characteristics. However, the major limitation of linear combination of signal observations is an amplification of receiver noise. To get benefit of two frequency signals, a suitable signal processing architecture is needed. By taking advantage of GPS L5/Galileo E5 signal characteristics, a dual frequency signal processing architecture is proposed with an aim to reduce the ionosphere-free signal observation noise and to enhance the L1/E1 signal tracking loop sensitivity. The L1/E1 signal tracking loop sensitivity can be enhanced by Doppler aiding from L5/E5 signal tracking loop. The low noise L5/E5 signal Doppler aid reduces the noise in the L1/E1 signal tracking loop. Moreover, two frequency signals tracked with common Doppler estimate will have common observation errors, which will get cancel in linear combination of observations i.e. ionosphere-free, wide-lane etc. Further, code phase observations can be smoothed (Hatch filter) using carrier phase observations. The carrier phase observations are limited by cycle slip. Hence, we have investigated an optimum combination of divergence-free and ionosphere-free pseudorange smoothing using dual-frequency carrier Doppler observations for GPS L1/L5 and Galileo E1/E5 signals. The cycle slip in carrier phase observations can be neglected in carrier Doppler observations. The proposed signal processing architecture incorporated in GPS L1/L5 and Galileo E1/E5 dual frequency receiver will ensure robust signal tracking and minimum pseudorange errors, suitable to a range of high accuracy standalone and code differential positioning applications. The performance of the proposed dual frequency signal processing architecture is evaluated with GPS L1/L5 signals collected from Block-IIF satellites.},

  abstract = {The quality of mobile mapping using multi-sensor systems depends on miscellaneous factors and defines the field of application of the mapping system. Quantity and quality of sensors, their calibration, and synchronization and of course their interaction in the complete system characterize the system. Data analysis and data fusion also influence the quality of mobile mapping. Given environmental conditions are additional factors. In case of land-based mobile systems an essential environmental factor is the shadowing of GNSS signals. Defining quality criteria for mobile mapping systems and comparing multi-sensor systems can be challenging. In this context a simulation framework is developed to analyze multi-sensor systems in a specific environment. In a modular setup various sensors are simulated and combined to a multisensory system. Besides simulating the sensors in their constellation, environmental information is also put in the simulation model. In this contribution we simulate an IMU/GNSS navigation system. We focus especially on a realistic setting that considers the limiting factor of shadowed GNSS signals. GNSS RINEX observations in a free sky scenario are simulated using the Bernese GNSS software. GNSS shadowing masks are drawn from a Digital Surface Model to eliminate shadowed GNSS signals. An IMU simulation tool completes the simulation toolbox for navigation. We demonstrate the functionality of the basic simulation tool for navigation and present an example that basis upon real measurements. We test the plausibility of the simulation by comparing simulated results with the real data results in an overall test.},

  abstract = {Modern Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are usually made of two components: a pilot and a data channel. The former is adopted to extend the integration time and improve receiver sensitivity, whereas the latter is used for data dissemination. Combining the two channels allows one to fully exploit the transmitted power and further improve receiver performance. The presence of data symbols in the data channel, however, limits the integration time in the combining process. When a pure data channel is considered, the integration time can be extended using a squaring operation, which removes the data symbols without affecting phase information. In this paper, Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation is used to derive the optimal datapilot combining strategy and extend the integration time beyond the data symbol duration. In this way, a generalized correlator is obtained as the linear combination of the pilot and data components. The data component is multiplied by a non-linear term, which compensates for the presence of data bits. Under weak signal conditions, this multiplication leads to a form of squaring, which generalizes the squaring correlator used in data-only processing. The weights of the combination depend on the signal amplitude and noise variance that need to be estimated. The ML solution is integrated into a Phase Lock Loop (PLL) and used to process GNSS signals with data and pilot components. The proposed algorithm and its performance are characterized from a theoretical point of view, using semi-analytic simulations and through the processing of GNSS signals generated using a hardware simulator. The derived method is compared with other data/pilot combining strategies with extended integrations showing the advantages and drawbacks of the different approaches.},

  abstract = {Robust Interference Mitigation (RIM) can significantly improve the performance of a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver in the presence of jamming. A key element of RIM is the adoption of a Zero Memory Non-Linearity (ZMNL) able to reduce the impact of signal samples that are identified as outliers or that are corrupted by interference. We consider the usage of the Huber’s non-linearity that is seen as an extension of the complex signum operator. Huber’s non-linearity implements jamming detection by comparing signal samples, eventually projected into an appropriate representation domain, with a decision threshold. The complex signum operator is then applied to the samples with a magnitude higher than the threshold. The effectiveness of the Huber’s non-linearity is evaluated theoretically, by simulation and with the analysis of real data corrupted by jamming. The decision threshold used by the Huber’s non-linearity allows the selection of the most appropriate compromise between loss of efficiency, in the absence of interference, and robustness to jamming. It is worth noting that the additional processing that RIM involves is minimally invasive when implemented on a legacy GNSS receiver.},

It is an innovative methodology to reduce the hypothesis space of sensor faults. In the proposed method, the measurement subsets to evaluate in MHSS are generated from the IMU/GNSS measurement set only, so that Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) in camera measurements takes place separately. In the investigated approach, anomaly prediction in state estimate error due to camera faults is performed based on raw images with a Deep Neural Network (DNN), and IM input is required only during the online refinement of predicted anomaly locations to reflect anomalies in the IM test statistic. This opens for the possibility to evaluate environment features and conditions that cause specific detected or undetected sensor faults. Experiments on the IMU/GNSS/Camera integration demonstrated that Protection Level (PL) bounding performance of the proposed IM, with limited hypothesis space and the individual camera FDE, is comparable to the MHSS IM informed by the full set of fault hypotheses. Despite the use case of the camera, the method can be directly extended to integrations with multiple auxiliary sensors, where each auxiliary sensor is evaluated individually for faults.},

Single-antenna receivers are prone to interference and spoofers and lack the possibility for mitigation. The usage of array antennas instead introduces the advantage to form spatial nulls in the direction of an emitting source. To counteract interferers, blind techniques can be employed for mitigation. In case of spoofers, deterministic approaches are typically desired. However, the analogue frontend channels introduce differential effects to incident signals while they travel from the reception at the antennas to the digitization at the ADCs, such as delay and frequency-dependent amplitude and phase characteristics.},

  abstract = {Antenna arrays and spatial signal processing techniques have proven to be the most effective countermeasures against radio interference (RFI). Beamforming algorithms such as the prewhitening filter estimate the covariance matrix from a finite block of digitized raw antenna signals. Subsequently a scaled inverse of the covariance matrix can be applied to the same signal block to decorrelate the signals and hence, mitigate incident jammers. The application of this algorithms supposes that the narrowband assumption is met, which is the case for compact arrays, such as uniform rectangular arrays (URAs). Through the comparably large size of the latter, a hidden installation in cars produced for the consumer mass market is not possible, which is on the other hand a strict requirement by industry and customers, such that the aesthetic design of the car is not infringed. Therefore, the authors of this paper presented a new array concept consisting of two uniform linear arrays (ULAs), which can be spaced several wavelengths apart from each other. With that additional degree of freedom and the reduced footprint of a ULA compared to a URA, this array allows for a concealed installation in the front and/or rear bumpers as well as the side mirrors of a car. On the other hand, the narrowband assumption is violated through the increased spacing between the ULAs. Therefore each antenna receives the signals with a non negligible delay and, furthermore, a different Doppler frequency, if platform rotations are considered. Both effects decrease the correlation of the impinging signal and hence the beamformer performance.},

The large size of uniform rectangular arrays with half-wave antenna spacing for the GNSS frequency bands impedes an installation in the consumer automotive area, where aesthetic design is a unique selling point and hence desired by the industry and its customers. This paper emphasizes a new approach, where a conventional uniform rectangular array is split into distributed sub-arrays. Care must be taken by the geometrical arrangement of the sub-arrays, as the array manifold and hence the DOA-estimation may become ambiguous, possibly leading to an accidential mitigation of incident satellite signals. Design rules for the distributed sub-arrays are therefore derived and the impact of the proposed array on beamforming algorithms on the example of RFI mitigation is discussed. The theoretical models of the respective antenna patterns are verified by measurements.},

As a drawback, the distribution of the ULAs requires cables with a length of several meters from the individual antenna elements to the central processing unit inside the car, which digitizes and processes the signals of all antennas together in the digital domain. Due to that, the signals are digitized with a non-neglectable differential delay in the baseband signals. The authors demonstrated by simulation and experiment, that it is possible to extend blind mitigation algorithms, which are typcially incorporated for RFI mitigation, to reduce the effect of the differential delay in case of radio interference. However, the delay must be estimated to be able to incorporate deterministic spatial processing algorithms as well, such as attitude estimation or spoofer mitigation.},

  abstract = {Ambiguity resolution enabled precise point positioning (PPP-RTK) immediately provides centimeter-level positioning information, once the carrier phase ambiguities are correctly resolved. With the ongoing GNSS development and modernization, a steadily growing number of satellites can be observed on multiple signal bands. The joint processing of multi-frequency multi-GNSS data leads to much stronger positioning models with shorter convergence times. However, we show that even when combining GPS, Galileo, BDS-2/3, and QZSS on up to five frequencies, instantaneous reliable ambiguity resolution is not feasible. Instead of fixing the ambiguities, we make use of the MSE-optimal best integer-equivariant estimator to investigate the limits of the positioning performance that can be achieved with the current constellations. A simulation-based analysis shows that instantaneous centimeter-level horizontal PPP-RTK results can indeed be expected when combining all four systems with three or more frequencies. Real-data experiments are used to confirm these findings. For an exemplary day, empirical instantaneous horizontal RMS positioning errors of 7–8 mm are observed when combining four systems and three or five frequencies.},

When traveling through turbulent patches of Earth’s ionosphere, these signals can experience scintillation, which is characterized by rapid fluctuations in the amplitude and phase of the received signal. Along with these fluctuations, the signal can undergo phase transitions that induce cycle slips in the resulting phase measurement. When left uncorrected, cycle slips can lead to large errors in positioning and remote-sensing applications. In this work, we look at how the technique of backpropagation based on a single-phase-screen model of the ionosphere can help mitigate the occurrence of these cycle slips.},

Based on this observation it is possible to detect abnormally large multipath error by monitoring the correlation function. Indeed for the tracking of the code delay, several correlator outputs that correspond to specific locations on the correlation function are observable. Based on the available observables that are combined to form a metric, one can design a test detection to quantize the distortion. The potential metric candidates are selected based on noise resilience considerations. Afterwards, using a simplified correlator output model, two methods are compared for the determination of the detection thresholds. The value of the thresholds is related to the expected Probability of False Alarm. An analytic way to assess the performance of the coherent tests in term of sensitivity is given. The efficiency of the test can be widely improved by smoothing the correlator outputs or the test variable itself. The discussed metrics are implemented on a realistic GNSS tracking simulator processing the Land Mobile Satellite Channel model developed by the DLR. The correlation between the multipath error and the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is well known. Performances of test based on metrics and SNR are finally compared.},

  abstract = {For the monitoring of high voltage overhead lines (HVOL) automated robotic systems increasingly come to use. Regardless of whether this is set to line-crawler technology or aerial platforms, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are used for position determination on all of these robotic systems. In aerial platforms they serve for precise navigation, but also – as with line-crawlers – for georeferencing of discovered defects on the power lines. Compared to conventional applications the increased electric and magnetic emissions in direct vicinity to the HVOL of up to one meter can be regarded as unique and harsh environmental conditions for the GNSS-components like antennas and receivers. To test the functionality and quality of real GNSS-components in realistically reproduced electromagnetic fields in a laboratory environment, test bench setups have been designed to reproduce the field strengths and emissions, in which for this publication a couple of GNSS-receivers have been tested. The focus of this paper is on low-frequent fields with grid-frequency (here 50 Hz) as well as corona-discharges as an example for broadband, high-frequency electromagnetic emissions of HVOL (0.2…20 MHz). The paper describes the conducted tests and compares and discusses the measured results, which are the recorded values for accuracy and availability of position determination, time-to-first-fix (TTFF) and carrier-to-noise-density-ratio (C/N0).},

In-band interference can occur deliberately from GPS jammers or naturally from spurious harmonics from nearby electronics that generate signal products that land in the GPS signal band. To support development and testing of GPS receivers in an interference environment, NAVSYS has developed a broadband GPS signal simulator product which includes the capability to either record live satellite signals during testing or generate simulated signals using the NAVSYS GPS Signal Architect software, and play these files back to generate simulated GPS RF signals for receivers under test. This product allows for broadband capture of the full GPS spectrum and also recording of interference environments. In this paper, we describe how this GPS signal simulator product will also allow during playback for a user to insert interference signals into recorded or simulated GPS signals in a non-jammed environment for testing of a GPS receiver in a simulated interference environment.},

  author = {Burchfield, Scott},

  institution = {{Auburn University}},
  abstract = {This thesis proposes the coupling of a Global Positioning System (GPS) L1 C/A vector tracking software-defined receiver with controlled reception pattern array array (CRPA) satellite constrained beamsteering, i.e. a multi-antenna vector tracking beamsteering receiver. As technology advances, the number of systems relying on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and precise positioning and timing is increasing. Improvements in robustness and overall design are necessary for receivers to estimate position, velocity, and time accurately in all environments. This work is inspired by previous receiver designs by NAVSYS [1] and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) [2]. The proposed receiver conducts pre-correlator beamsteering. Pre-correlator beamsteering is lower SWaP-C as it reduces the number of receiver correlator channels compared to DLR’s post-correlator implementation. The vector tracking receiver feeds back attitude corrected satellite geometry to a beamsteering module that updates the beam constraints as the extended Kalman filter (EKF) in vector tracking applies corrections. The proposed receiver is compared to a multiantenna scalar tracking receiver in all testing scenarios. Comparisons are also made with a single-antenna vector tracking receiver, a single-antenna scalar tracking receiver, and a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) receiver. In simulation, receiver performance using a range from one to eight element CRPAs is compared to understand the benefits different arrays offer to receiver design. The simulations show there is a diminishing return in signal quality improvements as the number of elements increase. The simulations also show that a seven and eight element implemented vector tracking receiver can track signals at carrier-to-noise ratios (C/N0s) as low as 12 dB-Hz, which is much lower than previously documented tracking thresholds [3]. The proposed receiver outperforms the other receivers when the simulation scenarios are noisy, improving PVT estimates considerably. Four element configurations of the receivers are tested with dynamic live sky collected data. The multi-antenna vector tracking beamsteering receiver outperforms the other receiver designs, aligning closely with the COTS receiver. The performance of the multi-antenna vector tracking beamsteering receiver is followed by that of the single-antenna vector tracking receiver, the multi-antenna scalar tracking receiver, and the single-antenna scalar tracking receiver, respectively. The receivers are also tested in a jamming environment. The proposed receiver offers a four dB improvement in jamming resilience compared to the single-antenna vector tracking receiver.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the dual-frequency airborne ionospheric gradient monitor proposed for dual-frequency multi-constellation (DFMC) Ground Based Augmentation Systems (GBAS) at different distances from the airport. We use two types of thresholds for this assessment: (i) a constant threshold derived from operational requirements, and (ii) a dynamic threshold that increases with the distance from the airport. Increasing the threshold allows more ionospheric error within the position solution, but also enables the use of the primary single-frequency modes without the need to switch to the ionosphere-free (Ifree) solution for a longer period, which generally degrades the performance because it combines the noise and multipath of two frequencies. Furthermore, we compare the performance of the two potential architectures for DFMC GBAS: (i) the so-called GAST F architecture, which is based on single-frequency 100 seconds smoothing, and (ii) the GAST X architecture, which is based on divergence-free (Dfree) smoothing with variable and potentially longer smoothing time constants. Results with both simulated and real data show that the use of a variable threshold significantly reduces the probability of excluding satellites and switching to the Ifree mode for both GAST F and X, thereby increasing the availability of GBAS.},

Dual frequency multi constellation (DFMC) systems are hence currently being deployed worldwide for different applications.

  abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is a popular positioning solution able to provide high accuracy, integrity, reliability and high coverage. GNSS performance may be enhanced through aiding systems such as Differential GNSS (DGNSS), which aims to mitigate disruptive sources of error by using corrections sent from a reference station. In this paper, we investigate a method that provides performance results comparable to those by DGNSS without the need for a reference station. We propose the Massive User-Centric Single Difference (MUCSD) algorithm, which leverages a set of collaborative receivers exchanging observables and, potentially, their noisy estimates of position and clock bias. MUCSD is implemented as an iterative weighted least squares (WLS) estimator and its lower accuracy bound, as given by the Crame´r-Rao Bound (CRB), is derived as a performance benchmark for the WLS solution. Simulation results are provided as a function of the number of collaborative users and the exchanged information uncertainty. Results show that, without having to access costly-to-maintain reference stations, MUCSD asymptotically outperforms DGNSS as the number of collaborative receivers grows.},

Twelve years later, the first atomic clock was realized, and in the 1970s the first atomic clock was launched into space. In the nearly half-century since that first space flight, atomic clocks for space have become more precise, more resilient, and as a result have proliferated into diverse space systems. Here, we begin with a very brief overview of how space systems can employ atomic timekeeping, followed by a discussion of present-day and (nearterm) next-generation atomic clocks for space systems.},

The EKF utilizes GNSS, IMU, and magnetometer sensor outputs for correction to its states. Unlike traditional GPS/INS error state recursions, the EKF processes the IMU outputs through the measurement observation matrix. The highorder EKF includes Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) to remove erroneous measurements. The navigation algorithm was evaluated with Pixel 4 and Pixel 4XL training data provided by the Google Smartphone Decimeter Challenge. The experimental results indicate the smartphones’ GNSS chip receivers provide positions with accuracies of roughly 1.5 meters at a rate of 1 Hz. The high-order EKF provides positions with accuracies of roughly 3 meters at a rate of 100 Hz. Furthermore, the highorder EKF can accurately navigate under motion with the IMU and magnetometer sensors for 5 to 10 seconds without GNSS. In cases when the GNSS has position faults, the EKF successfully rejects the outliers with FDE and continues to navigate. Future work includes augmenting the EKF with an adaptive process noise tuning algorithm, including sensor bias states for the IMU and magnetometer sensors, and comparing the high-order EKF to a traditional GPS/INS error state filter.},

Sensor suites based around RTK-DGPS are a common approach. But for many environments, multi-path or cycle-slip inducing maneuvers can further degrade or prevent fixing the integer ambiguities needed for precise navigation. Furthermore, UAVs are often considered expendable and thus come with low-cost sensors in many commercial applications. These low-cost sensors can not provide the needed accuracy for certain applications in addition to requiring a longer initialization period due to single frequency limitations.

An analysis of the sensor error on the algorithm estimation and the sensor field of regard requirement from the Air-to-Air Radar Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) is performed. The efficiency of the trajectory estimation has direct implication on the estimation of the intruder trajectory in relation to the own aircraft.

  abstract = {In recent years, autonomous vehicles have drawn attention from both academic and industrial worlds for their potential applications in a variety of fields such as logistics, mining, harvest and electronic sports. The objective of this work is to develop a demonstration system for indoor vehicles’ autonomous control and navigation. Position is one of the most important information for vehicle control, navigation and obstacle avoidance. In order to achieve accurate and continuous positioning capability, a high precision indoor wireless positioning system is developed and adopted. Based on this localization system, position accuracy of 3 cm (1-σ) can be achieved. Furthermore, the heading angle of the vehicle is also measured using two selfdeveloped positioning devices, and the error can be within ±10 degrees with a baseline length of 20 cm. A low-cost velocity sensor is equipped to bridge the gap between position fixes and filter off unacceptable position results. A modified control algorithm that controls both the speed and the direction of the vehicle based on the widely adopted fuzzy control idea is proposed and implemented. Ultrasonic sensors are installed on the vehicles to detect obstacles around. Avoidance of these obstacles is realized through a proposed algorithm that combines decision making and behavior control such as braking, backing and turning. Preliminary tests using smart mini-vehicles have shown that position and orientation information given by this system and the control algorithm can satisfy the demand of autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance for vehicles.},

  abstract = {The threat of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signal spoofing has grown in recent years and has motivated the research community to develop anti-spoofing techniques. Different approaches were developed, from those operating at digital signal processing level to those based on cryptography. This work focus on the class of anti-spoofing mechanisms that aims at protecting the GNSS signal by encrypting, completely or partially, the ranging code. The goal of this approach is to force the attacker to estimate the secret chips rather than arbitrarily generate a spoofing signal based on the known spreading code. This work will analyse the effective security level offered by this class of security mechanism as a function of the clock uncertainty of the victim receiver, the C/N0 advantage of the attacker and its attack strategy. Finally, a framework that allows to derive the amount of secret chips that the receiver needs to accumulate in order to meet its security target is presented, together with example obtained with a GNSS software receiver.},

The use of GNSS for tracking vehicles or goods has incentivized the malicious use of personal privacy devices (PPD) or jammers in order to disrupt the service. Usually jammers achieve denial of service (DoS) by the transmission of high power interfering signals, making it difficult for the victim receiver to correctly track the genuine signal. The approach of a traditional jamming attack can be seen as brute-force: it disrupts the service over a certain area rather than selectively targeting a particular device or signal.},

Indeed, in such environments, GNSS receivers are prone to positioning errors mainly due to multipath and interference. When a GNSS receiver tracks a signal affected by multipath, e.g., because it is reflected by close obstacles, it erroneously estimates the distance from the transmitting satellite. This phenomena is present particularly in urban environments, where fewer Line-of-Sight (LoS) signals are typically available and several signals (especially those which are Non-Line of Sight) are potentially affected by multipath.},

  abstract = {Over the last few years, new Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) applications have emerged that go far beyond the original objectives of GNSS which was providing position, velocity and timing (PVT) services for land, maritime, and air applications. Indeed, today, GNSS is used in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) for a wide range of applications such as real-time navigation, formation flying, precise time synchronization, orbit determination and atmospheric profiling. GNSS, in fact, can maximize the autonomy of a spacecraft and reduce the burden and costs of network operations. For this reason, there is a strong interest to also use GNSS for High Earth Orbit or Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) missions. However, the use of GNSS for HEO up to Moon altitudes is still new, and terrestrial GNSS receivers have not been designed to cope with the space environment which affects considerably the GNSS receiver performance and the GNSS solution (e.g. navigation solution). The goal of our research is therefore to develop a proof of concept of a spaceborne GNSS receiver for Earth-Moon transfer orbits, assisted by Inertial Navigation System (INS), a Star Tracker and an orbital forces model to increase the navigation accuracy and to achieve the required sensitivity.},

It usually requires a long convergence time for fixing ambiguities. The present work analyses the performance of a network of closely spaced (on the order of a few km or less) user receivers using standalone PPP-RTK with the addition of sharing precise STEC and ZTD estimates through a Peer PPP-RTK approach. These are applied by Peer as constraints for faster convergence to sub-decimeter accuracies.},

The GNSS satellite signals interact with free electrons along the propagation path to the receiver, leading to a group delay and phase advance proportional to the Total Electron Content (TEC). These refractive effects cause errors in the satellite range measurements which, if uncorrected, degrade overall positioning accuracy. Fortunately, the ionosphere is dispersive and the refractive effects on the carrier phases are proportional to the wavelengths of the carriers, to within first order. To mitigate the effects of ionospheric refraction, GNSS satellites broadcast radio signals at multiple frequencies. Multi-frequency GNSS receivers can utilize phase differences between carrier signals at different frequencies to deduce the TEC along the propagation path and correct for the ionospheric delay. In practice, they may not estimate the TEC directly, but instead use the so-called ionosphere-free linear combination of the observed phases to cancel the first order effect due to ionospheric refraction.},

While these specialized receivers provide high fidelity scintillation diagnostics such as the scintillation intensity index (S4), more numerous are inexpensive commercial off-the-shelf receivers capable of measuring the rate of change of total electron content index (ROTI). Several realtime GNSS networks currently operate receivers of this type including the International GNSS Service (IGS), the Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS), the Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS), and the network operated by UNAVCO. Radio occultation (RO) satellite systems, such as the upcoming COSMIC-2 mission, may also be used for this purpose. ROTI is widely used to indicate the presence of ionospheric irregularities, and as a proxy for S4 because of its wellknown correlation with that parameter. Due to the Fresnel filtering imposed by diffraction, however, phase and intensity metrics are sensitive to different fluctuation scale-sizes in the turbulence. As a consequence, the search for a quantitative relationship between ROTI and S4 has remained elusive until now.},

As unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become more ubiquitous, the manipulation of GPS capable UAVs is becoming a greater threat to their use. One method of mitigating these attacks employs the use of multiple antenna arrays. These arrays are utilized in many GPS dependent systems. These GPS capable UAVs using multiple antennas are restricted to a short baseline multi-antenna system similar to Controlled Reception Pattern Arrays (CRPA) sizes. Differential GPS measurements are used for Angle of Arrival (AOA) calculations which are used to locate the threat in question. The AOA estimations and attitude are a function of the baseline of the multi-antenna array in use. This paper explores the analysis of multiple antenna baselines and the impact the chosen baseline length has on the estimation of the electronic threat location.},

  abstract = {Frequency-locked loops (FLLs) are important in many signal processing applications, including communications and satellite navigation. Direct design of the discrete-update FLL (DFLL) in the digital domain is outlined herein and offers many advantages over the discretization of analog design, including the ability to better control the loop bandwidth and damping. The transfer functions, loop bandwidths, and loop constants that describe the DFLL are derived, and an iterative algorithm for computing the loop constants based on the desired loop bandwidth and update interval is provided. Theoretical performance is examined in terms of steady-state tracking error, random errors due to noise, and expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) losses due to tracking errors. The theory is supported through simulation, and the tradeoff between noise suppression and dynamic performance is highlighted. It is shown that using the DFLL constants derived in this paper is critical in ensuring that actual DFLL performance can be accurately predicted and controlled.},

We derive a general expression for the gain of such discriminators, show that it depends on the effective carrier-to-noise ratio, and evaluate it for several different code discriminators and GNSS signals, including GPS C/A-code, P-code, L1C, and M-code, Galileo E1 OS, GLONASS L1OF and L2OF, and BeiDou B1 and B2. We also analyze how noise and interference saturate the discriminator and the resulting effect on loop bandwidth. The discriminator gains derived in this paper compensate for the saturation and ensure that loop bandwidth and code tracking performance can be accurately predicted and controlled over a range of effective carrier-to-noise ratios.},

Only pseudorange observables are accounted for and a centralized extended Kalman filter, which can deal with both cooperative and non cooperative measurements, has been developed. The filter is complemented with a fault detection and elimination strategy based on Mahalanobis distance, which removes pseudoranges that are deemed faulty. Contribution of relative sensing sources (camera or ranging devices) and formation geometry to cooperative GNSS integrity mitigation is investigated, and the concept of cooperative slope is introduced as a metric to define the best cooperative formation geometry. Results demonstrate, by simulating spoofing and multipath phenomena, that cooperation enhances the navigation performance of the UAVs in a multi vehicle formation only if the formation geometry is correctly selected with the aid of the cooperative slope metric.},

The proposed approach is based on the idea of supporting the flight of a ("son") UAV in challenging environments, by means of one or more cooperating ("father") UAVs flying under nominal satellite coverage. Relative sensing and information sharing are the basic cooperation mechanisms. Different sensing architectures are presented in terms of filtering schemes, with the focus set on measurement equations and the relevant covariance matrices. The concept of generalized dilution of precision is introduced as a way to predict the son positioning accuracy resulting from available GNSS observables and cooperative measurements, and can thus be used to individuate optimal formation geometries and navigation performance bounds. Both numerical simulations in different scenarios, and first results from experimental datasets, demonstrate a good consistency with the achieved navigation accuracy. Experimental data show how proper formation geometries allow cooperative visual measurements to provide meter-level positioning accuracy for relatively long timeframes, even exploiting only two available pseudoranges.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation (HiLs) tested via square Helmholtz coils as a relative magnetic field generator. In technical terms, the HiLs is an indispensable tool for engineering design during rapid prototyping of attitude determination and control algorithms for the turning parameters that control the attitude of the satellite, since most of the satellite’s mission relies on its attitude, making this system one of the most essential to the satellite’s operation. Moreover, performing controlled experiments with the parameters for developing adaptive control algorithms improves the overall efficiency of the satellite’s kinematic system. The conceptual design of a proposed system architecture can be composed of the electrical currents of 2.4-meter square Helmholtz coils produced by a low-level microcontroller equipped with a DC-motor driver by a pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal through real-time connection to an orbit propagator using a high-level computer. This research focuses on the attitude dynamic of satellites through the interaction between the Earth’s magnetic field (EMF) and the magnetotorque in the satellite. To apply this phenomenon, the intensity and the direction of the magnetic field must be identified through Biot–Savart’s law. Along with the EMF, the reference position is calculated using the standard general perturbations satellite orbit model (SGP4), and the intensity is modeled based on coefficients from the 13th edition of the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF). Therefore, this paper presents a detailed development of a HiLs testbed for distributed attitude determination and control systems (hardware and software codesign, protocol, and control theory). Furthermore, it discusses a classic cooperative control case for the output of magnetic field intensity and direction, which was undertaken to explain the integrated simulation process and validate the effectiveness of the co-simulation tested to be a primary experiment.},

This paper reviews the need for such an IMU and current state of the art.

The mechanical, electronic and digital control approaches are outlined and the planned progression of development models leading to a final IMU product are discussed including early environmental test assessment. Finally recent development test results using an enclosed CVG with front-end electronics mounted on an IMU test block with improved digital control and compensation demonstrating repeatable drift performance over an 8-hour period with 0.015 deg/h in-run stability are reported.},

In this paper, our two-channel URC ASIC design is described for control and readout of the two inertially-coupled modes of a vibratory gyroscope or the two uncoupled modes of a dual beam vibratory accelerometer. Like the evolution of the high yield, high performance operational amplifier, single, dual, or quad channel URC ASIC configurations are anticipated to implement singleaxis, two-axis, or three-axis IMU or INS. Our first URC ASIC has been submitted for fabrication in a 4.1mmx4.1mm, 180nm CMOS die. Each URC additionally provides digitally selectable analog gains and two DACs per channel with up to 30V range for tuning of residual machining errors, on-line precision quadrature or amplitude control. A low power digital demodulator is being developed with FPGA for subsequent CMOS integration. With this universal ASIC architecture and exemplary wafer-levelpackaged, high Q MEMS in-plane resonators, a compact 2D and 3D Navigation System on Chip (NSoCTM) architecture is enabled to increase the production scale and radically reduce the cost, size, weight, and power of electronics and systems for numerous existing and future highly compact MEMS inertial navigation applications.

  author = {Chandler, David M and Liessner, Christopher and Cash, Peter and Trainoff, Mark and Dutra, Cody and Dimare, Steve and Juppe, Michael and Ellett, Jackie},
  abstract = {The 5071A cesium primary frequency reference was first introduced in 1992. Due to its exceptional stability, accuracy, reliability and simplicity of operation, the 5071A has become a time and frequency industry icon. Over 500 units have contributed to international atomic time (TAI) since 2016. The 5071A is also widely deployed in global navigation satellite system (GNSS) ground stations, calibration services, government and defense systems, radio astronomy and critical infrastructure. Demand for the system has grown recently due to both increasingly stringent system timing requirements and GNSS denial concerns. Unfortunately, like all electronics assemblies, keeping the product manufacturable with the increasingly shorter life-cycle of many components is a challenge. Adding to this challenge is the number of components required to build a 5071A and the influence even minor component changes may have on a system with an accuracy of 5E-13 and a flicker floor of 1E-14. In 2017, a major multi-year refresh effort called the 5071B project was initiated with a goal of maintaining 5071 production through at least 2035 to support both defense and critical infrastructure requirements, while also implementing RoHS compliance to support sustainability initiatives. The purpose of this presentation is to provide users objective data to assure them that the product performance and reliability of the product has remained unchanged during the refresh project, while also ensuring longevity of supply. The primary focus of the project was to deliver the same clock with updated components without any changes to the form, fit or function of the system. To minimize the risk of performance degradation, no new functionality to the hardware or changes of the firmware were incorporated. For redesign purposes, the system was divided into 20 subsystems, and each subsystem was required to also have backwards compatibility with the existing subsystem to ensure future serviceability of fielded units. Each component on the over 2000-line product structure was analyzed for RoHS status and life cycle status. Based off these results a decision to either keep, integrate a drop-in substitute, redesign a portion of the circuit, or execute a last time was made. A three-phases testing plan. that spanned over two years. was conducted to analyze any changes in system performance. Each phase included the standard production acceptance test, an extended temperature test, and a 26-week minimum Allan deviation test to measure the long-term stability to at least 1,000,000 seconds. After the phased testing, certification and qualification testing were completed. The presentation will provide details of the entire project from the design phase, through the three phased manufacturing and test of the 20 individual modules, and their integration into the eight pilot units. A comparison between over 700 5071A production units and the eight pilot 5071B units will be presented along with analysis of minor variations that occurred during the testing, and how they were resolved. Eventually newer clock technologies like optical clocks and cold atom clocks will reach a manufacturing maturity and reliability level that will replace the 5071, however until that time arrives the 5071B will continue to be available to serve as the world’s primary frequency reference.},

  abstract = {Obtaining an accurate navigation solution for cycling applications using portable devices without applying constraints is very challenging, especially during unavailability of absolute navigation information, such as from the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). The main challenges are: (i) the device containing the sensors is not tethered to the moving platform, but rather moves with respect to the moving platform (here a bicycle), meaning the device could be on the body of the cyclist and undergo any type of motion dynamics as well as vibrations; (ii) the device, and consequently the frame of the sensors inside, can be in any orientation with respect to the direction of motion of the cycling platform, and this relative orientation (defined as misalignment between the device and platform or bicycle) can change at any time; and (iii) the error characteristics of the used low-cost inertial sensors lead to an increase in positon errors during the unavailability of absolute navigation information.},

The desired information q is explicitly identified in PPR approach, which is usually overlooked by conventional formula perspective in Convolution Theorem implementing serial search. First, the approach is based on the relationship between time shift information and phase of complex phasor developed from a single component of DFT (discrete Fourier transform). Then the approach is extended to give a geometric interpretation of Convolution Theorem (i. e., x[ n ]  y[ n ] F  X (  )  Y(  ) , where  denotes convolution and F denotes Fourier transform) in complex domain. The desired information－code phase shift q is explicitly identified in our approach, which is imbedded in the phase of each phasor during each stage: Fourier transform, point-wise product operation, and inverse Fourier transform. The code phase information is explicitly traced, formulated, and represented geometrically in complex domain in each stage.},

  abstract = {Extreme natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions, have been demonstrated to create visible pressure waves in the atmosphere and trigger observable ionospheric wave responses that may travel hundreds of kilometers in the ionosphere, which is the ionized area of the Earth's upper atmosphere. During the Tonga volcano eruption, the acoustic and gravity waves are generated that can cause ionospheric total electron content (TEC) perturbations and variations. The TEC determines the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) ionospheric delay and can cause significant positioning errors, which may affect the performance of GNSS based applications. In this paper, GNSS data collected from the Hong Kong Satellite Positioning Reference Station Network are processed to analyze the ionospheric activity and positioning performance responding to the serious Tonga volcano eruption in the southwest Pacific on 15 January 2022. The TEC Rate (TECR) and Melbourne Wubbena Wide Lane (MWWL) linear combinations are applied to detect and repair cycle slips jumps. A Savitzky-Golay low-pass filter with a 30s window is used to improve the TEC accuracy. The changes in TEC, ROTI, and positioning errors in the eastward, northward, and upward directions after the anomalous ionospheric propagation to Hong Kong between 11:30 and 14:30 were investigated. It was found that the ionospheric anomaly could generate large changes in the three parameters, with peaks up to three times the calm period. This prompt research contributes to a better understanding of the coupling of extreme ionospheric activities and dynamics caused by volcanic eruptions. It is of great significance for ionospheric modeling and prediction, which further benefits GNSS applications.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, GNSS Radio Occultation soundings have proven an invaluable input to global weather forecasting. The success of government-sponsored programs such as COSMIC is now complemented by commercial low-cost cubesat implementations. The result is access to more than 10,000 soundings per day and improved weather forecasting accuracy. This movement towards commercialization has been supported by several agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Air Force (USAF) with programs such as the Commercial Weather Data Pilot (CWDP). This has resulted in further interest in commercially deploying GNSS-RO on complementary platforms. Here, we examine a so far underutilized platform: the high-altitude weather balloon. Such meteorological radiosondes are deployed twice daily at over 900 locations globally and form an essential in-situ data source as a long-standing input to weather forecasting models. Adding GNSS-RO capability to existing radiosonde platforms would greatly expand capability, allowing for persistent and local area monitoring, a feature particularly useful for hurricane and other severe weather monitoring. A prohibitive barrier to entry to this inclusion is cost and complexity as GNSS-RO traditionally requires highly specialized and sensitive equipment. This paper describes a multi-year effort to develop a low-cost and scalable approach to balloon GNSS-RO based on Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) GNSS receivers. We present hardware prototypes and data processing techniques which demonstrate the technical feasibility of the approach through results from several flight testing campaigns.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with invariant extended Kalman filter (IEKF) which has a trajectory-independent property by defining the error state using the Lie group, unlike the conventional Kalman filter. Inertial navigation system (INS) is a widely used navigation solution providing 6 degrees of freedom motion. Since the performance of the INS tends to deteriorate with time, it requires another aiding sensor. In the fusion of the INS and such aiding sensor, the Kalman filter or its variants are mainly adopted. Specifically, it is wellknown that an IEKF is effective when the initial attitude estimation error is large. There are two types of IEKFs, left IEKF (LIEKF) and right IEKF (RIEKF). It is known to be advantageous to adopt the LIEKF for the left-invariant measurements and right-IEKF for the right-invariant measurements. However, there have been few studies that have analyzed in detail the degradation of performance when it is used with the opposite IEKF. Therefore, this paper evaluates the performance of left-/right-IEKF according to the invariancy of a sensor measurement.},

PMUs use GPS signals for synchronizing measurements and are vulnerable under GPS Spoofing Attacks (GSAs). The corrupted PMU measurements under GSAs degrade the performance of the grid monitoring State Estimators (SEs). Experimental datasets containing both GPS and PMU measurements are essential to evaluate the performance of SEs under GSAs. Available datasets are GPS only and are not relevant to the power grid community. Due to the lack of datasets, researchers use low-fidelity simulations that simulate PMU measurements to evaluate the performance of SEs. In this work, we design a two-step methodology for generating GPS and PMU integrated datasets. In the first step, we modify a GPS simulator to generate GPS datasets under timing GSAs. In the second step, we conduct Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) simulations with a virtual power grid consisting of Real-Time Digital Simulator (RTDS), PMUs, and GPS clock. In HIL simulations, we transmit the generated GPS datasets to the virtual power grid and record PMU datasets. Finally, we validate the integrated datasets for different spoofing scenarios.},

  abstract = {GPS integrity monitoring is essential to ensure the safety of critical infrastructures, such as power grid, banking, and transportation systems. The integrity of a system is assessed using protection levels (PLs). PLs overbound positioning and timing errors using error models. Positioning errors have multi-modal Gaussian distribution due to changing environmental conditions. The number of modes present in the multi-modal distribution is not known and poses a challenge in overbounding errors using a multi-modal distribution. Direct positioning (DP) is an unconventional GPS receiver architecture that utilizes signal-in-space and provides position, velocity and time (PVT) solution in a single step. DP is robust against errors that arise due to multipath or signal blockage. In this work, we propose a Bayesian algorithm to estimate PLs for DP. We model the positioning error with a time-varying Gaussian distribution to capture the multi-modal behavior. Our Bayesian algorithm use DP likelihood manifold to estimate PLs. The effect of changing environmental conditions is captured by DP likelihood manifold, which is a function of timevarying variance. In this paper, we focus on overbounding vertical positioning errors of DP using our Bayesian algorithm. We generate 24 hours of stationary GPS data using a high fidelity GPS simulator. We show that the vertical positioning error distribution for DP is multi-modal. We further validate that our estimated VPL bounds vertical errors for DP.},

Hence, the difference of pseudorange between spoofing and authentic signals can be an effective separation basis. In this paper, a new approach based on relative positioning is proposed to separate GNSS spoofing from authentic signals, which is capable of substituting the detection and classification investigated in conventional works. Monte Carlo simulations and outdoor experiments illustrate this point in the end.},

In this paper, the basic principle of the cross-correlation mitigation method based on subspace projection is analyzed and the architecture of suppressor is presented. The corresponding subspace matrix for strong signals can be constructed after the receiver acquiring the code phases, carrier frequencies and data-bit modulation of all strong signals. The projection of the input signals onto the strong signal subspace is the sum of the strong signals and the projection of the noise. Then the projection can be used as an estimate of the strong signals. After subtracting the estimated strong signals from the input signals, the result consists of weak signals, noises and the residue error resulted from the projection operation. Then the acquisition and tracking of the weak signals can be implemented. Two kinds of receiver structure have been proposed for two different scenarios. One is for that the strengths of the strong signals are almost the same. And the other is under that the strengths of the strong signals are largely different.},

This method uses ultrawideband (UWB) with high-ranging accuracy and a high transmission rate as the positioning sensor. The drone and the target are equipped with multiple UWBs, and the relative distance is calculated through the signal transmission between the UWB devices so as to determine the position of the target in a fixed coordinate system. In practice, this method uses the UWB anchors on the ground to locate the UAV moving in the air, and the altitude error can be reduced from 8–10 m to less than 1 m. The moving UAV can also be used as the anchor to locate fixed objects on the ground in areas with poor GPS, and the relative position error is reduced from 2.02 to 0.35 m, and the relative altitude error is reduced from 3.39 to 0.32 m. This study alleviates the insufficient accuracy of the trilateration method when the UWB anchors are in the coplanar space, so as to improve the reliability of the positioning and navigation of the UAV in the GPS-denied area.},

This becomes a direct obstacle for using techniques such as Differential GNSS (DGNSS) in smartphones for enhancing the positioning accuracy. Without the need to access raw measurements, this paper presents a differential solution, differential GNSS in coordinate domain (DGNSS-C), based on smartphones. By carrying out DGNSS computation in the coordinate domain, the DGNSS-C algorithm utilizes the pseudorange corrections to estimate the coordinate corrections, and applies the coordinate corrections to the initial coordinates obtained from the GNSS chipset. The field test demonstrates that the DGNSS-C algorithm enhances the positioning accuracy by 30-40\% in terms of 3D error, and the performances vary in different phones due to different chipset designs that might give rise to model errors in the DGNSS-C correction processing.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the meteorological and ionospheric responses of a meteorological tsunamis (meteotsunamis) event that impacted southwest Kyushu, Japan on 25 February 2009. This event is identified by local sea-level pressure anomalies started at \textasciitilde 11:27 UT and lasted 18 hours with a maximum air pressure disturbance of \textasciitilde 1.5 hpa. Sea surface height anomalies were observed at \textasciitilde 13:00 UT and lasted for about 26 hours with a maximum perturbation of \textasciitilde 290 cm. Such perturbations of both sea level and sealevel pressure are likely associated with two subsequent traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) events which were observed in total electron content (TEC) derived from ground-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) networks in Japan. The first TIDs occurred at \textasciitilde 11:41 UT which is 1.5 hr before the meteotsunami could be an early warning of meteotsunami. It has a wave front aligned in the northwest-southeast direction and propagated in the direction of southwest. This TIDs is more likely a manifestation of gravity waves (GWs) which might accelerate the growth rate of Perkins-type nighttime medium-scale TIDs (MSTIDs). The second TIDs took place at \textasciitilde 21:42 UT. Its wave front is characterized by concentric rings (referred to as CTIDs), likely corresponding to concentric GWs (CGWs). The characteristics of the CTIDs are corroborated with radar echo intensity measurements obtained from the Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System (AMeDAS) and with the optimal waves source searching technique. Based on the radar echo intensity and optimal waves source searching results, the generation mechanism of the CTIDs could be meteotsunami and/ or deep convection. This suggests further investigation of ionospheric responses due to meteotsunami is needed.},

As an indication of quality of orbit and clock products, the value of URA is of great importance for the quality controlling and integrity monitoring. In this paper, we mainly analyze the real time precision orbit and clock product from Centre National d’Études Spatiales (CNES). The accuracy and error distribution characteristics of real-time products can be obtained firstly. And then, we analyzed the correlation among the radial, along, cross errors of orbit and clock errors. Finally, We studied the computational strategy of URE and URA. URE is mainly affected by satellite clock errors, and do not satisfy Gaussian distribution. URA value is about 0.03-0.35 m getting from Root Mean Square (RMS) estimation of URE. URA has no obvious correlation with satellite type, but it is different with different satellites, which need to be accounted for high precision and high integrity navigational applications.},

The joint VPLL uses a common loop based on extended Kalman filter (EKF) to estimate the dynamics experienced by satellite signals and individual loops to track the dynamics experienced only by signal of individual satellite. The carrier phase prediction performance of the joint VPLL method is first analyzed under kinematic mode using a land vehicle. The test results show that, when one satellite is blocked, the joint VPLL can predict the carrier phase of the blocked satellite for at least 15 seconds before the phase prediction error exceeds a quarter-cycle which is the pull-in range of two-quadrant arctangent discriminator. A conventional prediction strategy is then implemented based on standard receivers and compared to the joint VPLL. The results show that the performance of the joint VPLL is much better than the conventional strategy. The sensitivity performance of the joint VPLL under kinematic mode is also analyzed and the field test results show that the sensitivity of the carrier phase tracking based on the joint VPLL can be improved by about 4 dB compared to the scalar tracking.},

Both software algorithms and hardware components were taken into account. The sensor was composed of commercial off-the-shelf components and operated using algorithms in Lost-in-Space mode or tracking mode, which included star identification and star mapping. To verify the usability and evaluate the performance of the developed star tracker, a simple laboratory experiment was conducted indoors, where simulated star fields were displayed on a screen and captured by the sensor. The purpose of this paper was to develop a star tracker whose size fit into a CubeSat envelope, as well as to provide arc-minute accurate attitude estimation at a 20 Hz processing rate based on a hardware-in-the-loop simulation test in a laboratory.},

Hence, the high cost and complex calibration of antenna arrays decrease the attractiveness of CRPA to many user communities. We develop an approach which can perform CRPA without any prior information. Specifically, inexpensive and Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) antennas can be used as elements of an antenna array. This allows the elements to be easily arranged to any desired array layout. With this new freedom in array geometry, the important issue of its effect on performance is raised.

  abstract = {Existing unusual aviation weather detection systems use the weather information provided by several ground-based meteorological observation stations in the vicinity of airports. However, most ground meteorological observation stations are near the ground surface level, so they can only detect unusual aviation weather conditions through a proximate two-dimensional analysis. With only two-dimensional weather information, it is difficult to issue a warning for unusual low-level weather conditions, such as low-level wind shear and microbursts. To augment the existing system to provide weather anomaly information about 1,500 feet above the runway, the onboard surveillance and navigation signals broadcast by commercial aircraft via the automatic dependent surveillance broadcast (ADS-B) datalink is considered a source of vertical weather information. Thus, this paper is aimed toward determining whether aircrafts are encountering unusual aviation weather condition by using these data to acquire the weather information. To achieve this object, the correlation between actual aircraft onboard sensor data and unusual aviation weather conditions are evaluated based on several unusual aviation weather detection algorithms and machine learning method. Moreover, the verification and performance results and analysis of the proposed unusual weather detection method are discussed. The machine learning model can provide accuracy rates of close to 96\% for detecting unusual aviation weather conditions. Finally, a graphic user interface is constructed to integrate these functions and then present unusual aviation weather information.},

  abstract = {An algorithm is developed for determining the attitude of a spinning sounding rocket. This algorithm is able to track signals with low availability duty cycles, but with enough accuracy to yield phase observables for the precise, 3-axis attitude determination of a nutating rocket. Raw GPS RF front-end data are processed by several filters to accomplish this task. First, a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) batch filter performs a leastsquares fit on a bank of correlators to generate GPS observables for multiple satellites. These observables are then used as measurements in a Rauch-TungStriebel (RTS) smoother that optimizes estimates of carrier phase, Doppler shift, and code phase. Finally, attitude determination is carried out by another batch filter that uses the single-differenced optimizal carrier phase estimates between two antennas. The batch filter itself is a combination of a substantially modified form of the LMA and the Least-Squares Ambiguity Decorrelation (LAMBDA) method. It is configured to deal with integer ambiguities that are constantly changing due to the long data gaps between times of carrier phase availability. The algorithm presented in this paper is applied to recorded RF data from a spinning sounding rocket mission in order to produce attitude quarternion and spin-rate estimates. These results are confirmed by another set of quaternions and spin-rate vectors independently estimated from magnetometer and horizon crossing indicator data.},

The local clock – usually a crystal oscillator (XO) or a temperature compensated crystal oscillator (TCXO) is sensitive to temperature changes. Components are suqeezed on a limited space (printed circuit board (PCB)) of a smart phone. Each electronic component is a heat source. Thus the local clock is easily impacted by the thermal vibrations from the sourrounded components. The thermal vibrations create excessive dynamic stress on the GNSS receiver and cause performance degradations in positioning. This paper illustrates the problem; verifies the correlation between the impaired clock signals and the GNSS receiver performance; proposes both hardware and software solutions, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the solutions by the final positioning performance of the GNSS receiver in a compact smart phone.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present an improved error model for long-range pose estimation using AprilTags. AprilTag is a type of fiducial markers. Fiducial markers are artificial landmarks placed in the vision systems for use as reference points or to obtain measurement data. Fiducial markers provide precise pose of a camera relative to the markers, but there are some factors that inhibit accurate pose estimation. The main cause of pose errors when using fiducial markers is the image coordinate errors of the detected AprilTag. The image coordinate errors consist of random errors and systematic errors, which are caused by inaccurate camera calibration. No significant pose errors are observed during short-range estimation, but large pose errors may occur during long-range estimation due to image coordinate errors. Therefore, we developed a pose error model for the long-range use of AprilTags. In the experiment, an AprilTag was detected under various configurations of the AprilTag and a camera by changing the distances and attitudes. In each experiment, image coordinate data and pose estimation data were obtained. We also performed camera calibration several times using CALTag. The experiments showed that pose errors tend to increase according to the distance between a camera and an AprilTag. Based on the experimental results, the covariances of the image coordinates and calibration are defined and pose errors are modeled using the non-linear least squares problem and unscented transform, respectively. The pose model was evaluated by performing a comparison between the covariance of pose errors and real pose errors, and he increasing pose errors in long-range estimation were well predicted by the error model. The analysis of AprilTag and error modeling demonstrates the potential of AprilTag as a reliable localization system that can be applied to outdoor localization or autonomous landing.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses a navigation system using multiple rangefinders and 3D maps for urban canyon environment. In urban canyon environment, it is difficult to use global navigation satellite system (GNSS) due to lots of buildings blocking its signals. To overcome this challenging environment, we utilize the obstructing buildings. By matching the ranges from a vehicle to nearby buildings with 3D maps, it can be realized. The relationship between the measured ranges and the position of the vehicle, that is, the measurement model, is modeled as a discontinuous piecewise linear function because ordinary buildings are a combination of finite-size planes. In general, nonlinear filters will be required to treat this nonlinear measurement model. However, it is not easy to fully implement a nonlinear filter based on numerical methods to the navigation computer of small-size, multi-rotor type unmanned aerial vehicles. Therefore, we proposed a filter scheme similar to the Gaussian particle filter that deals with nonlinear problems using sampling techniques and regards a resultant probability density as a Gaussian distribution. However, approximating the result to a single Gaussian distribution may be inadequate for situations where multimode occurs. Therefore, we employed the expectationmaximization algorithm for clustering and selected the best cluster by Kullback-Leibler divergence. For verifying the performance, Monte-Carlo simulations were performed assuming actual urban environment, and a flight experiment was conducted in an area similar to urban canyon. Simulation results and an experimental result confirm that the proposed method improves the navigation performance compared to a previous method.},

For this purpose, several Advanced RAIM (ARAIM) algorithms have been proposed and extensive evaluations [1], [2], [3] have been implemented in order to achieve global coverage of LPV200. Previous work [4] has demonstrated the performance of multi-constellation ARAIM with real data. However, the previous evaluation focused on accuracy and Vertical Protection Level (VPL) requirements. In addition, that effort only tested nominal case and one satellite fault situation. Therefore, additional effort is necessary for other requirements, which is addressed in [3], [5]. Moreover, tests with extended failure states, such as multiple satellite failure and a constellation failure, must be performed to test the ability of multi-constellation ARAIM to provide integrity.},

In the absence of overlapping multipath, it optimizes the interpolation of a few correlators to locate the peak of the correlation, i.e., the time of arrival of the signal. A key point is that noise whitening is applied post-correlation. We show how it outperforms classical code phase discriminators in terms of converging to an accurate TOA, for both the coherent and non-coherent cases, at high or low SNR. For the noncoherent correlators, we show the benefit of computing the correlators covariance matrix. The discriminator can use any set of correlators having any spacings, and it can account for time drifting correlators and for PRN auto-correlation distortions. A benefit is improved responsiveness to satellite tracking in difficult environments. Faster convergence to the solution enables efficient software implementations and reduced power consumption. The ML discriminator is particularly suitable for computationally intensive wide band systems such as GPS L5, or for terrestrial beacon systems such as TerraPoiNT, 4G or 5G.},

The project assumes creation of a mathematical model of air navigation based on GNSS and INS solution as well as integration of the result with digital elevation model (DEM) of the airfield and surroundings. This solution will allow for the future implementation of a fully functional navigation system in any type of the aircraft. Thanks to the system, the pilot will have a permanent access to an accurate and reliable information on the actual elevation and possible obstacles in the vicinity of the plane in each phase of flight, regardless of weather conditions.},

The initial implementation of the GM-PHD filter provided estimates for the set of target states at each point in time but did not ensure continuity of the individual target tracks. It is shown here that the trajectories of the targets can be determined directly from the evolution of the Gaussian mixture and that single Gaussians within this mixture accurately track the correct targets. Furthermore, the technique is demonstrated to be successful in estimating the correct number of targets and their trajectories in high clutter density and shows better performance than the MHT filter.},

  abstract = {This thesis presents the analysis techniques developed for monitoring GPS signals in harsh shadowed environments such as heavy foliage. It also details a method selected for improved performance by combining raw GPS information with an Inertial Navigation System (INS). Normal GPS operation in shadowed areas suffer from position jumps of tens to hundreds of meters. The developed analysis reveals that these errors are due to the quickly changing local errors that cause a GPS receiver to report erroneous position spikes. Monitoring variables for the signal strength and change in multipath are employed to keep track of the environmental effects on the GPS measurements. A new visualization technique is also developed to qualitatively monitor the environmental effects. From the visualization technique, the effects of the shadowing environment are shown to simultaneously affect the signal strength and multipath. It is shown that foliage cover causes these effects to occur spontaneously as a signal travels through and around obstacles. To mitigate these errors, a GPS/INS closely coupled system is implemented which uses inertial sensors to smooth the erroneous GPS jumps. Introduction of alternative sensors allows for integrity monitoring in the form of GPS outlier measurement rejection so that local environmental effects can be detected and removed from the navigation solution. The resulting implementation reveals that it is possible to operate in these GPS harsh environments without suffering from the position jumps of tens or hundreds of meters. This implementation allows for navigation in foliage cover comparable to the under ten meter accuracy of standard GPS in clear environments.},

For inertial sensors, such a signature is conveniently obtained by recording data at rest. The analysis of this signal will result in noise-parameters adequate to such situation. Nonetheless, the value of the noise parameters may change under dynamics or other kind of external influences like for instance the temperature. In this research we study first the influence of the rotational dynamics on the signal of MEMS gyroscopes and then we show how to link this property to the noise-parameter estimation in a rigorous way by a modified version of the Generalized Method of Wavelet Moments (GMWM) estimator. The results of such analysis can then for instance be used in a Kalman filter, where the noise parameters are adapted according to such predetermined functional relationship between sensor noise and the encountered dynamics of the platform/sensor.},

  abstract = {This paper explores two-step and direct geolocation of terrestrial Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) jammers from Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Within the past decade, there has been a sharp increase in GNSS outages due to deliberate GNSS jamming. Receivers in LEO are uniquely situated to detect, classify, and geolocate terrestrial GNSS jammers. The conventional two-step geolocation method first estimates the differential delay and differential Doppler, then uses a time history of these to estimate the transmitter location. By contrast, direct geolocation is a single-step search over a geographical grid that enables estimation of the transmitter location directly from the observed signals. Signals from narrowband, matched-code, and chirp jammers recently captured in the GNSS frequency bands by two time-synchronized LEO receivers over the Eastern Mediterranean are analyzed and the emitters geolocated. It is demonstrated that the direct approach is effective even for low signal-to-noise ratio interference signals based on short captures with multiple emitters. Moreover, the direct approach enables geolocation of multiple emitters with cyclostationary signals (e.g., chirp jammers), whereas the two-step method struggles in such cases to associate emitters with their corresponding structures in differential delay and Doppler space.},

  abstract = {This paper explores single-satellite single-pass geolocation of terrestrial Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing signals from Low Earth Orbit (LEO). GNSS spoofers transmit an ensemble of false GNSS signals intending that the victim(s) receiver will accept them as authentic signals and infer a false position fix and/or a clock offset. Receivers in LEO provide a unique opportunity to detect, classify, and geolocate terrestrial GNSS interference. Single-satellite-based transmitter geolocation is possible from Doppler measurements alone, assuming a carrier can be extracted from an interference signal. There are proven single-satellite Doppler-based geolocation algorithms, but they only apply to emitters transmitting at a constant frequency. By contrast, GNSS spoofers transmit signals whose carrier frequency contains an unknown time-varying frequency component that imitates the Doppler corresponding to each individual spoofed navigation satellite. This paper develops a single-pass single-satellite technique that removes the unknown time-varying frequency component added by GNSS spoofers so that a Doppler (range-rate) time history can be extracted for geolocation. It is shown that the true range rate between the terrestrial spoofer and LEO-based receiver manifests in the spoofed receiver clock offset rate estimate. Monte Carlo simulations are developed that investigate how transmitter motion, transmitter clock offset rate, and spoofed clock offset rate affect geolocation accuracy. The proposed method is validated by simulating the reception of terrestrial GNSS spoofing signals on a LEO-based receiver and achieving under 10 km accuracy. Additionally, recent real-world GPS spoofing signals captured by a LEO-based receiver are analyzed.},

  abstract = {This research investigates the mutual interference between a GNSS signal refracted through the atmosphere and the same signal reflected from the surface below. For low altitude occultations, the path length difference between the direct and reflected signal is small enough that the reflected signal can be present as multipath when tracking the direct signal. This poses a problem when making remote sensing measurements using GNSS-RO or GNSS-R techniques. Here, this issue is addressed in context to GNSS data collected by an antenna dish on the summit of Haleakala on the Hawaiian island of Maui. GPS L1, L2, and L5 signals are tracked and the signal intensity is calculated in post processing. First, a definition is proposed for the multipath presence transition elevation, a threshold below which the reflected signal can be present as multipath on the direct signal. This threshold is calculated for the GPS signals collected in the mountaintop geometry. Next, the first steps are taken to mitigate the mutual interference between the direct and reflected signals. A frequency-domain filtering approach and a time-domain smoothing approach are both applied to the signal intensity in an effort to separate the multipath contribution and the direct signal contribution.},

  abstract = {In GNSS reflectometry, GNSS signals reflected from the surface of the Earth are used for environmental remote sensing, such as estimating ocean surface winds. In this context, wind speed retrieval algorithms have been developed and are in operational use. These algorithms utilize a data product called the delay-Doppler map (DDM), a measure of the received scattered signal power. Of course, measuring ocean surface vector winds also requires knowledge of the wind direction, which has proven to be a far more difficult target. A technique called ambiguous stare processing, which follows a number of fixed points on the surface as they propagate through a sequence of DDMs, has exhibited a sensitivity to wind direction. However, a full vector wind retrieval algorithm has not yet been established. In this paper, such an algorithm is developed and tested using sequences of DDMs simulated for a spaceborne receiver in low-Earth orbit. Samples of the normalized bistatic radar cross-section are taken from the DDMs and compared to a model to simultaneously retrieve the wind speed and direction. The algorithm performance in terms of the wind direction retrieval RMS error is reported for different choices of the sampling scheme and the quantity of DDMs used. The most favorable result shows that the wind direction can be retrieved under the presence of noise with an RMS error of 30 degrees, while maintaining a spatial resolution better than 50 km.},

  abstract = {It is well known that civilian Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers are vulnerable to interference. Robust interference reduction can be accomplished through a combination of temporal and spatial filtering using antenna arrays; however, current solutions absorb surface area and add weight to the host platform. These rigid fixed arrays are impractical for systems whose mobility and portability are distinguishing qualities such as smartphones, smart sensors and autonomous vehicles. Research is needed to expand the interference mitigation options available to GPS-dependent platforms constrained by size, weight and power (SWAP) while maintaining their mobility. This paper formulates a collaborative solution where independent receiver nodes behave as antennas in a multi-node antenna (MNA) array. Wideband interference mitigation is accomplished through spatial null-steering with space-time adaptive processing (STAP). Selection-combining diversity is proposed to circumvent grating nulls which reduce the usable beamspace (UBS) of the MNA array. A modeling and simulation (M\&S) tool is leveraged to show that the MNA array with antenna diversity scheme achieves interference mitigation and conserves UBS while introducing bias into the navigation solution. Position bias may be acceptable in many civilian applications when the only alternative is to navigate without GPS.},

  abstract = {Multipath severely degrades the tracking performance of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers, creating inaccuracy estimates and possibly causing the loss of lock. Previous research shows multiple methods to detect, suppress, mitigate or correct multipath in various receiver processing stages. However, these methods are implemented at the cost of increased complexity, being challenging to apply in real-time GNSS receivers. This paper evaluates the behavior of the loop-bandwidth control algorithm (LBCA) under controlled multipath scenarios. The proposed technique is a low-complex adaptive tracking architecture using the LBCA. The LBCA is an adaptive tracking technique that adjusts the time of response of the tracking channel based on the discriminator’s statistics. This adaptive tracking architecture is implemented in an open software interface GNSS hardware (GOOSE) receiver and is evaluated under simulated controlled multipath scenarios. These scenarios present a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signal with different time offsets, carrier phase offsets, and frequency offset levels. The results confirm that the LBCA can serve as a multipath suppression technique at fast fading multipath scenarios. Moreover, multipath indicators from the response of the adaptive tracking architecture are found at slow fading multipath scenarios.},

  abstract = {The Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich (MF) spacecraft is the latest in a 30-year series of reference ocean altimeter missions, requiring high accuracy precise orbit determination (POD). This paper develops two improvements in solar radiation pressure (SRP) modeling for this spacecraft – an estimated macromodel and an empirical solar radiation pressure (SRP) table, that result in better orbit accuracy. The challenges of estimating highly coupled SRP effects and antenna calibrations for the largely yaw-fixed Sentinel-6 MF spacecraft are addressed through constrained dynamic orbit solutions. Using more than 500 days of data, we demonstrate improvements in the consistency of drag and solar scale estimates, antenna calibrations, measurement residuals, and orbit precision. Reduced-dynamic, ambiguity-resolved POD solutions with the new SRP models show improvement in comparison with independent Satellite Laser Ranging tracking measurements from 8.6 to 8.1 mm (RMS).},

The GRACE-A satellite was used to assess the orbit determination errors of CYGNSS using a single-frequency code-only and GRAPHIC approach. Orbit overlap RMS values were lower using GRAPHIC than code-only for both GRACE and CYGNSS indicating a more precise orbit solution. With GRACE, the orbit errors for GRAPHIC were smaller for all three components, radial, cross-track, and in-track. Based on the GRACE error analysis, we conclude that the 1𝜎 CYGNSS GRAPHIC orbit accuracy is 3 – 5 cm for radial, 5 – 10 cm for cross-track, and 10 – 15 cm for in-track placing the 3-D accuracy between 12 – 20 cm.},

With connectivity available worldwide, mobile devices are excellent candidates to establish crowd sourced global relays that feed multi-frequency GNSS sensor data into a cloud processing environment.

We present the results of experiments made to measure the stability of an unsynchronized cellular network. These show a large heterogeneity in the overall stabilities of the time signals from the individual cellular base stations and the importance of the mechanisms used to control disciplined oscillators. We introduce an ensemble filter with the goal of improving the long-term stability of the local oscillator in a mass-market GPS device, without the need for specific equipment in the cellular network. The filter is evaluated for two types of oscillator models and we show that a simple random-walk model can provide time aiding with an accuracy better than 50 μs over 4 days in a GSM unsynchronized network.},

For this purpose, an image processing pipeline is employed to estimate the heading of a vehicle. To assess the method, an acquisition card has been built and coupled with two moving platforms: a rotary stage and a moving ground vehicle. The results show that, in a dynamic car experiment, the root mean square error of the orientation is 4.29◦ as compared to a Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation System.},

However, in challenging GNSS scenarios, classical GNSS/INS integration estimators are very sensitive to multiple measurement faults (e.g., due to multipath). In this work, we design a tightly-coupled integration between GNSS and INS where we modify the update step of a classical Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to consider more robust estimators, like M-estimators. We consider different faulty scenarios where the pseudoranges contain one or several non-modeled biases and ramps. The tightly-coupled GNSS/INS robust Kalman filter performance in the presence of faults is compared with the classical EKF and with a loosely-coupled Robust-GNSS/INS approach. The robust tightly-coupled version is able to minimize more efficiently the faults effect thanks to the direct redundancy of the inertial sensor within the robust estimator.},

  abstract = {As the Global Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSS) signals are received and processed by the GNSS receivers with an extremely low power, they are vulnerable to non-intentional and intentional interference. In particular, the intentional transmission of Radio Frequency interference, known as jamming, can completely prevent the operation of GNSS receivers. The integration of measurements from multiple sensors with complementary error characteristics offers a possible countermeasure against jamming and, therefore, it can provide a position solution that has sufficient accuracy for the applications. This paper shows how a Deeply Coupled (DC) integration of GNSS with Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) and visual sensors enhances the robustness of the navigation system in presence of jamming. In particular, the effect of DC integration for jamming mitigation is investigated for a dynamic scenario where jamming signals have been added to a pre-recorded GNSS scenario by using the record and replay approach, emulating different interference levels. The results presented in this paper show that the deep coupling of GNSS with INS and visual sensors can sustain the navigation in presence of high power jamming, although such a strong interference completely masks the GNSS signal denying the navigation of a GNSS stand-alone system. Moreover, the test procedures suitability of the record and replay approach for the jamming scenario generation and combination with real datasets are discussed and analyzed.},

  abstract = {With the advent of new services and the evolution of transportation systems the need of a reliable and accurate knowledge of the position information became of paramount importance. Among the multiple technologies and sensors that might be used for positioning, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) can be considered as the core technology and a superior system capable to provide the user with estimates of his own position in a global reference frame. Unfortunately, received GNSS signals are extremely weak and thus vulnerable to non-intentional and intentional Radio Frequency Interference. In particular, the malicious intentional interference produced by jammers is proliferating and it is becoming a serious threat for GNSS receivers. The integration of GNSS and external sensors with complementary characteristics, is the key for overcoming the weaknesses and enhancing the strengths of each sub-system. In this paper, the design of an ultra-tight hybrid navigation system is proposed with the aim to enhance the robustness of the navigation system in presence of jamming. A GNSS unit has been integrated with external sensors, namely Inertial Navigation Systems, visual sensor and odometer. Exploiting the “record and replay” of real GNSS signal artificially augmented with jamming interference within the L1 GNSS bandwidth, the performance has been assessed in controlled scenarios. The results presented in this paper show that the multi-sensor integrated system can sustain the navigation even in presence of severe jamming, although such a strong interference completely masks the GNSS signal denying the navigation of a GNSS stand-alone system.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a sub-meter real-time positioning service for smartphones is presented. Known as FLAMINGO, the service has been in operation since early 2020. Relying only on GNSS currently, FLAMINGO can deliver 50 cm or better accuracies to consumer devices such as smartphones or IOT. The Android smartphone is considered in this paper, harnessing the availability of Google Android Raw GNSS Measurements, which have been made available to Huawei, Samsung, Xiaomi, and other Android handsets since 2016. Since the release of these measurements, the GNSS community has made significant progress to improving the performance of GNSS in the smartphone. FLAMINGO harnesses the best-of techniques from PPP and RTK, modifying, and tweaking the configuration and pre-processing to improve the raw GNSS measurements from an Android device. These measurements are prone to high errors due to the poor quality of the mobile chipset receiver. Given these drawbacks, sub-meter positioning is achieved. This is demonstrated through static baseline tests, and suburban and urban kinematic trials. These tests have been repeated to ensure the user always experiences an accurate and reliable service. It is important to consider that all tests have been performed live, where a test app was developed to replicate the user experience of FLAMINGO.},

  abstract = {ÐA growing number of services rely on global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) for positioning and timing, but the widespread adoption of GNSSs has also increased the incentive to mount attacks against them, such as jamming and spoofing. While several security mechanisms have been proposed against these attacks, the most promising solution relies on spreading code authentication (SCA) or spreading code encryption (SCE). This paper analyzes the performance of a novel attack strategy targeting GNSS signals protected by SCE or SCA, assuming that the attacker has no prior knowledge about the secret part of the spreading code sequence. The considered attack strategy minimizes the distinguishability between authentic and forged signals, and turns out to be a linear transformation of the signal received at the attacker position, combined with an independent additive white Gaussian noise. The performance of the attack is evaluated through simulated GNSS signals, considering different scenarios and synchronization non idealities, such as code phase and carrier phase estimation errors.},

Results are presented in terms the Cross track errors, probabilities of collisions within the defined mission parameters as well as GPS metrics as it is the Dilution of Precision (DOP), along its distribution within the 3D map, in order to correlate the impact of GNSS degradation into each control strategy and therefore, the navigation performance and operation safety.},

A very difficult and time consuming reacquisition is the consequence.

In single antenna receivers a very similar effect can be observed in urban canyons. According to the movement of the receiver different parts in the receiver’s skyplot are obstructed due to buildings or other obstacles. Vector tracking is a well-known technique to improve the GNSS availability in such scenarios.

  abstract = {Positioning in indoor environment is one of the most important and interesting topic in navigation system that still present numerous open problems to investigate. Many researchers are attempting to investigate on technologies able to reach valid location in an indoor space, where the well-known GNSS positioning systems are not able to operate. Among the many solutions proposed for location-based services, several wireless communications technologies have the potential to be employed for indoor positioning. In this paper, an Ultrawideband (UWB) indoor positioning commercial system is presented which exploits two-way time of flight (TWTF) to compute range measurements. These measurements are used in multi-lateration method to compute the position of a transreceiver (TAG). Firstly, the calibration results have been shown, comparing the internal IMU sensor of UWB system with a massmarket one, using the angles measured thanks to the total station as reference. Secondly, we also have statically analysed the positioning and the ranging capabilities of the system in a favourable environment, as an indoor office room. The average 3D accuracy obtained from the test is 100 ± 25mm. Also the ranging measurements has been analysed as the raw data from which the Pozyx® inner algorithm starts to compute the positions. It has been demonstrated that the range accuracy is about 320 ± 30mm. After these first tests, the system has also been tested in a harsh environment in a narrow corridor where a horizontal accuracy of about 87.4 mm is obtained with a maximum ranging error of ±225 mm. The system and algorithms tested in this report gave almost similar performances in both environments.},

  abstract = {Precise positioning is a much stricter constraint nowadays, especially after the introduction of the GNSS chipset in mobile devices. The diffusion of Continuous Operating Reference Stations (CORS) has permitted the improvement of positioning solutions even in the case of low-cost instruments. The main bottleneck of the Network Real-Time Kinematic (NRTK) positioning is the presence of CORSs, which are costly and need other subsidiary structures to guarantee the continuity of the service, such as the power supply and a stable high-speed internet connection. In this work, starting from some stations of the Centipede network, we implemented a true NRTK network based on low-cost devices as master stations, providing an opensource service to test the positioning performances using two different network products generated by this new infrastructure. The tests have considered both static and kinematic surveys, including pedestrian and vehicular applications. Two different classes of rover devices have been considered in order to generalize the results, focusing the attention not only on precisions and accuracies but also on the percentage of epochs with phase ambiguities declared as fixed, as well as on the percentage of false fix solutions. The results are really promising, and they open new frontiers for involving the open-source community to improve this infrastructure to guarantee a better diffusion of the service as well as the correlated products, like atmospheric monitoring analyses.},

  abstract = {Bayesian Direct Position Estimation (BDPE) is a novel and promising positioning method, where the Position, Velocity and Time (PVT) is estimated directly from the correlation values of a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver. A natural approach for this method is the usage of Bayesian filtering techniques, such as a particle filter, which also allow for non-linearities in the system and observation model and being able to cope with non-Gaussian multi-modal distributions. One essential step within Bayesian filters it the measurement update (particle weight update), which updates the current state of the filter with a new set of measurements. Therefore, an optimal measurement update equation exists in literature, which considers a numerically stable evaluation of the weight update equation and accounting for residual user range errors (orbit, satellite clock, atmosphere or multipath) by introducing a nuisance parameter for the range measurement. This work discusses the problems with the optimal but plain measurement update and extends the existing framework by introducing an additional nuisance parameter for the Doppler. Similar to the range measurement also the Doppler can be biased e.g. by clock drift errors or multipath. The results of the extended approach are shown on a real-world dataset.},

  abstract = {The sector of mass-market global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers experiences a continuous growth, and the demand for reliable and precise positioning becomes higher than ever, considering for example the increasing number of location based services (LBS) in smartphones or the field of autonomous driving (EUSPA, 2022). In these applications, size and shape of the antennas become subject to form-factor driven design, leading to degraded GNSS performance mainly caused by unfiltered multipath. Most GNSS receivers are already available loosely or tightly coupled with an inertial navigation system (INS) to improve the robustness and positioning performance, but precise positioning techniques like real-time kinematics (RTK) and Precise Point Positioning (PPP) still degrade when multipath is present. Nevertheless, a rarely investigated pure software based method, which is called synthetic aperture processing (SAP) or ”Supercorrelation”, is capable of purifying the GNSS observations from multipath on the tracking loop level. Thus, our overall target is the realization and evaluation of SAP in a newly developed MATLAB software receiver (MSRx) using both low and high-quality sensors, which unravels to three steps: At first, the implementation and analysis of an external Doppler-aided phase locked loop (PLL). Second, the realisation of an external carrier-range aiding of the PLL including co-operated (CO-OP)-tracking to estimate the receiver clock, and third, the increase of the coherent integration time, e.g. up to 1-2 seconds, to fully exploit the effect of SAP beamforming. The first step, i.e. the external Doppler-aided PLL, implicitly exploits the concept of SAP to a certain extent, when considering proper settings. Consequently, this stage can be seen as a simplest form of SAP. This work focuses on this rather trivial realization of SAP using an external Doppler aided PLL and discusses the achieved tracking performance and positioning results.},

  abstract = {Onboard GNSS-based satellite navigation is becoming a reality due to the need for current and planned Earth observation missions to be equipped with real-time, high-accuracy positioning. In this perspective, an existing Precise Onboard Orbit Determination (P2OD) software (SW) tool, developed at the University of Padua, has been used as a starting point for an upgrade to a higher level of performance to meet the needs of real-time onboard navigation. The current features of the SW are presented along with a solution quality analysis. The SW is based on Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) using a reduced-dynamics approach. The force model implemented is comparable to those used in high-accuracy, ground-based processing, employing empirical accelerations to take into account residual force mismodeling. A test case using Sentinel-3A GPS dual-frequency data is analyzed. The computed orbit has been compared to the official ESA precise ephemeris over an 18-days period, showing a 7.6 cm and a 14.5 cm 3D RMS difference when using IGS final products and IGC products, respectively. Moreover, we investigate the use of stale ancillary data (Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP) and Solar And Geomagnetic Activity (SAGA) data) with a latency of several days—a relatively common situation for missions not supported by an extensive ground-station network. It is described how outdated ancillary data impact the solution depending on the reference frame used to model empirical accelerations. The reduced-dynamics approach is exploited to ensure the state vector prediction capability also during GNSS data outage. Here, we report on the results obtained for a selenocentric orbit (LRO mission data), showing a 3D RMS difference w.r.t. published estimated orbits lower than 5 m after three orbital periods. Finally, the current developments are described in the context of the onboard technology demonstration ESA/GOMspace GOMX-5 CubeSat mission within the DEIMOS G3PSTAR GNSS receiver in the second half of 2022. These include the capability to process dual-constellation, i.e., GPS and Galileo data, and the Galileo High Accuracy Service (HAS) corrections.},

  abstract = {Low cost receivers providing GNSS code and phase raw measurements for multiple frequencies and multiple GNSS constellations have recently become available on the market. This significantly increases the number of devices equipped with the necessary sensors to perform precise GNSS positioning like Network-RTK or PPP. The smartphone GNSS measurements often suffer from low signal-to-noise, inhomogeneous antenna gain and high levels of multipath. Here, we show how to tackle several of currently present obstacles and demonstrate centimeter-level kinematic positioning with a low-cost GNSS antenna and a low-cost GNSS receiver built into an off-the-shelf smartphone. For some devices we found that the phase observations do not have integer characteristic but appear to have random biases. To some extend these observations can still be used in a “float”type precise algorithm. Low cost GNSS sensors like the ones built into smartphones are generally used with antennas that have a uniform gain pattern and do not reject LHCP signals. Accordingly, strong multipath influence is observed in many applications. Experiments both in a zero-baseline and a short-baseline configuration have been performed, to evaluate the aforementioned biases and discontinuities. We demonstrate instantaneous ambiguity resolution in the zero-baseline setup, showing the potential for RTK-positioning with low-cost sensors available inside smartphones. Positioning with PPP-RTK or Network-RTK is more challenging because additional residual atmospheric noise is present. Experiments with different baseline lengths have been performed in different ionospheric conditions and the achieved accuracies are reported.},

The automated method scans scintillation indices recorded by SAGA for array-wide intervals of phase scintillation, amplitude scintillation, or both phase-and-amplitude scintillation at each of L1 and L2 frequencies. For each of the scintillating time intervals found, plasma density data from the collocated Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) are used to attribute the GPS signal scattering to either the E layer or the F layer of the ionosphere, based on whether the peak density is above or below 200 km altitude. The vast majority of scintillation events are phase scintillations, whether at L1 or at L2C. While the majority of them are attributed to the F layer in 2014, the majority of the scintillation events in 2015 are attributed to the E layer, based on the PFISR data. This indicates that E-layer-related scintillation may be quite common at auroral latitudes, and that GPS receivers are sensitive to the irregularities occurring there.},

The 2DOF algorithm uses the sequence of raw camera images to estimate the camera tilt angles and subsequently compensates the images such that the camera image plane is coplanar with the tiled surface. The 4DOF algorithm then takes the sequence of tilt-compensated images as the input and uses Least Squares (LS) and Kalman Filter (KF) processes to estimate the differential translation, azimuthal rotation and change in height between two consecutive image frames. The algorithm has been verified experimentally to provide robust performance while achieving an accuracy of few millimeters in the estimation of the trajectory.},

Using concepts from interval mathematics four different deterministic bounding methods will be applied on GPS positioning, namely: Least Squares Adjustments based on Interval Analysis (LSA-IA), extension of LSA-IA by means of Zonotopes, Linear Programing (LP) applied to the navigation equation linearized by Taylor expansion, and finally solving the non-linear navigation equation by Set Inversion Via Interval Analysis (SIVIA). These methods provide different type of confidence regions and inconsistency measures. Each method will be investigated alone, then conducting a comparison study of the mathematical properties of these methods, and providing geometrical interpretation with respect to the navigation problem (e.g. form and orientation of the bounding area w.r.t. line-of-sight and number of satellites in view). Thanks to a reduced position scatter and the implicit inconsistence measure, the LP approach seems especially promising for further investigation towards an alternative integrity concept.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a basic framework for cognitive and collaborative navigation of small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (sUAVs) with a focus on operation in challenging environments where GNSS performance may be deteriorated or even unavailable. The basic framework is based on a dynamic decision system where swarm members, a.k.a. agents, collect local sensor data and data from other agents in the swarm, to estimate the absolute and relative pose state of the swarm and its members and, hence, get better situational awareness to make decision that maintain safety but also satisfy the mission objectives. The paper discusses one possible way to integrate this swarm information using factor graphs and non-linear solvers. Simulation results will show the initial effectiveness of this method within the current architecture. The paper will, furthermore, describe the hardware and software architecture of the TU Berlin swarm test sUAVs and focus on the common GNSS, IMU, range radio board (SwarmEx) that forms the common core of the platforms’ sensor payloads. Some initial results of the range radio performance will be included as well. Finally, the flight test environment will be described.},

  abstract = {We are not going back to the Moon, we are going forward to the Moon” said Jan Woerner, Director General of the European Space Agency (ESA) in 2018, as reported by Space News [1]. Indeed, in the context of Deep Space Exploration as planned by the International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG), the Moon represents a significant step to feed forward what could be done on Mars. The main interests for the lunar exploration are related to In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), tourism, science and mining. The most famous lunar projects, such as the “Moon Village” [2] and the Chinese lunar exploration mission, Chang’e 4 [3], to only cite a few, demonstrate how the interest in uncovering our Moon mysteries continues to gain momentum. More specifically, the South Pole region is the target of the vast majority of the upcoming lunar missions, given the potential presence of water under its surface. To ease this process, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), in collaboration with other international space agencies, is developing a platform called the Deep Space Gateway (DSG) or Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway (LOP-G) [4]. This gateway, orbiting the Moon in the Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO), seeks to facilitate the transfer of space modules to the lunar surface [5].},

However, GNSS signals can be highly degraded or denied in some challenging environments as urban canyons, forests, mines and indoor environments. In addition to these critical scenarios, no orientation (or attitude) information is provided by standard receivers. Thus, in order to enhance robustness and performance of navigation solutions, it is possible to rely on integration with GNSS of measurements coming from other sensors, such as inertial sensors, barometers, magnetometers, cameras and other systems that can be used for positioning. The objective is to go towards seamless positioning, integrating measurements adaptively based on availability and reliability of the different systems.},

To this end we resort to a task prioritisation technique using a nullspace-based projection approach. This allows decoupling the motion objectives from those of maximising an observability based criterion. Preliminary results on this topic have been presented in previous work. Here, a careful singularity analysis of the null space projector operator is formalized and discussed. A saturation management algorithm that copes with vehicle velocity command saturation by properly assigning the velocity vector to the two tasks is also proposed. The stability of the resulting control law is analysed using a Lyapunov-based approach. Robustness against uncertainty in the initial position of the vehicle is also handled by comparing two alternative procedures: the first aims at optimising the worst case scenario, that is, maximising the minimum of the observability metric inside the uncertainty region; the second, a novel approach, aims at optimising the most frequent observability metric inside the uncertainty region. The work is completed by combining the guidance algorithm with an observer for the estimation of the vehicle’s position and its associated uncertainty. Results of numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

  abstract = {During the past decade, Galileo (Europe) and BeiDou (China) satellite systems have been expanded, bringing their total number of in-orbit satellites to 26 and 35, respectively. In combination with GPS (USA), the redundancy of observations has increased, improving the precision, availability and robustness of satellite positioning worldwide. Low-cost single-frequency receivers could largely benefit from these combinations of GNSS, as for instance in the case of safety-of-life applications, for which system failure may be critical. In this contribution, we tested the possibility of improving the positioning performances of single-frequency lowcost receivers by using a tight combination of Galileo E1 + GPS L1 frequency. We evaluated positioning precisions of u-blox EVK M8T receivers, which cost a few hundred USDs, in multi-GNSS relative positioning based on code and phase double differences (DD). We compared the results obtained with those of geodetic receivers, which cost thousands of USDs. The use of a unique-pivot satellite for both constellations in GPS L1 + Galileo E1 double differences introduces differential receiver hardware delays between GPS and Galileo, also called Inter-System Biases (ISBs). We studied both ISBs between low-cost receivers and ISBs between lowcost and geodetic receivers in an ISBs-float short baseline double difference model. We then quantified the positioning precision improvement brought by multi-GNSS single-frequency ISBs-fixed solutions with respect to ISBs-float solutions and multi-GNSS double differences where ISBs are ignored.},

  abstract = {Modern global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers need to be robust towards interference to operate under challenging environments, such as out-of-band interference and jamming. A few regional navigation systems, such as navigation with Indian constellation (NavIC), utilize S-band frequency for navigation solutions in addition to L-band. However, utilization of the S-band for navigation solutions provides many challenges to designers of both GNSS navigation signals and signals used by other services. For instance, the NavIC S-band signals are interfered by the out-of-band S-band sources that fall in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz frequency band range. Furthermore, due to interference from various terrestrial communication systems such as wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth, long-term evolution (LTE), and industrial scientific medical (ISM) band, the positioning performance of the NavIC receiver gets degraded. A possible solution is to implement interference detection and mitigation algorithms that operate directly on the intermediate baseband signal processing level. This paper focuses on the development of a detection and mitigation algorithm for the NavIC S-band signals by means of vector tracking loop (VTL) based software receiver architecture. The detection algorithm performs a hypothesis test to detect interference in the received signal, and the mitigation algorithm minimizes the error propagation in the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Several data were collected and analyzed in the presence of Wi-Fi interference to evaluate the performance of the proposed vector tracking-based algorithm. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) value of the horizontal position for vector tracking-based receiver with and without the proposed algorithm are 4.37 m and 13.92 m, respectively. However it was 27.11 m for the conventional scalar tracking-based receiver. This shows that the proposed vector-based detection and mitigation algorithms perform better than the conventional tracking approaches.},

  abstract = {Spoofing is a false transmission of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals, and it aims to mislead a GNSS receiver. Although the unauthorized transmission of signals in the GNSS frequency range, and thus spoofing, is prohibited, there are a significant number of attacks worldwide. Without any spoofing detection method the GNSS receiver is helpless against an attack but the detection requires additional receiver complexity, which not all receiver have readily available. Coupling of different sensors, GNSS with integrated navigation system (INS) or 5th generation mobile networks (5G), enhances the robustness. But altering the spoofed signal within the tolerances of the other sensors limits the sensor fusion detection. Having pre-information from one of the fused systems if there is a spoofing attack ongoing, can improve the overall performance and enhance the system reliability. With the new 5G standard, such information can be shared. This paper presents a use case where early spoofing reporting from the network can assist the fusion algorithms adapt and obtain superior performance promptly. Three test cases: unspoofed, spoofed, and spoofed with network assisted alert flag, are explored. Therefore, a measurement campaign was conducted to record the 5G data. The GNSS data is simulated for a fair comparison, as a spoofing attack can only be simulated. For each test case the standalone GNSS and 5G, and the 5G-GNSS fused approach is processed. These are compared to analyse the position performance and to showcase the advantage of the network assistance.},

  abstract = {Regular GNSS receivers use scalar tracking loops to track each satellite signal in view independently. In challenging environments, like urban canyons, the visibility of the satellite signal is not always good enough to reach a stable tracking. Signal degradations have a high impact and reduce the robustness and precision of the receiver tracking and position, velocity, and time (PVT) solution. Another approach, the vector tracking (VT), where signals are tracked with relation to each other, overcomes this weakness. There, the tracking and PVT solution estimation is done with an interlaced algorithm. Additionally, the tracked satellites are connected via an extended Kalman Filter. Present developments have shown good results in a light urban environment with a real time implementation of the vector delay lock loop (VDLL). There, only the scalar code tracking loop was replaced with a vector approach. The carrier loops are still independent and closed with scalar tracking loops. To achieve even better results this paper explains the enhancement of the VDLL to a vector delay and frequency lock loop (VDFLL), where the complete scalar tracking is replaced by the vector loop. A simulated test with GPS L1 C/A signals was done and the results are presented and discussed. With the VDFLL the system has to deal with additional error and noise due to the included carrier tracking. It requires an appropriate system model for effective operation, and the loops have to be closed simultaneously for all channels and as fast as possible to avoid timing issues.},

  abstract = {The combination of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), commonly used as economic outdoor navigation solution, and the Inertial Navigation System (INS) is widely developed and has become the baseline for numerous autonomous applications. However, the classical tightly coupled GNSS/INS (TC-GNSS/INS) navigator is very vulnerable to multiple faulty measurements in challenging GNSS conditions, including multipaths, partial sky visibility and non-line-of-sight (NLOS). This article addresses the problem of achieving a robust low-cost TC-GNSS/INS solution of an autonomous robot for the aircraft ground inspection application. In such a challenging navigation scenario, the performances of the classical TC-GNSS/INS can be strongly degraded by contaminated GNSS measurements. In literature we can find a certain number of contributions on the design of estimation algorithms based on robust statistics, which show that the robust TC-GNSS/INS approach is capable of mitigating large positioning errors in simulations or some specific experiments. To the best of our knowledge, for the purpose of aircraft ground inspection by autonomous robot, there is no related evaluation work with experimental data. To fill this lacuna, we propose to assess the use of a robust statistical approach, based on an M-Estimator formulation in a TC-GNSS/INS framework, with inertial and GNSS measurements of a real aircraft ground inspection scenario, where the faulty measurements are no more subject to Gaussian law. The implemented M-estimation-based robust extended Kalman filter (M-EKF) is compared with the standard EKF (S-EKF) and the navigation solution provided by the commercial u-blox M8T GNSS receiver. A series of data analysis on the behaviour of the M-EKF along with the GNSS raw measurements is carried out and discussed in details. The results show that the M-EKF is capable of mitigating the unexpected large errors by applying appropriate weights on the measurements outliers. This work provides a deep analysis on the use of the robust estimator in the case of an autonomous robot for the aircraft ground inspection. We also provide references and perspectives on this subject.},

  abstract = {Most Global Navigation Satellite System ephemeris representations rely on the user equipment implementing a straightforward, but specialized, algorithm in order to extract the correct transmitter position. As potential PNT signal sources expand beyond medium Earth orbit (MEO) to geostationary (GEO), inclined geosynchronous (IGSO), and low Earth orbit (LEO), modifications to these specialized representations are required, to properly capture the different dynamics of these regimes and operational characteristics of the host satellites. Researchers have already introduced several new modifications for these specific cases. Our work explores the use of B-splines as a highly flexible framework for creating transmitter ephemerides, applicable to any orbital or airborne regime and host platform. A B-spline curve is made of sections of connected piecewise polynomials and are fully defined by curve order, a sequence of knots and coefficients. The user implementation requires a very simple algorithm to compute satellite positions from the B-spline ephemeris representation. A key advantage of the B-spline approach is that it requires no knowledge or orbital mechanics or platform dynamics to compute satellite positions. This work presents the proposed B-spline ephemeris and compares the accuracy achieved and message length required for this representation, to examples of the current GPS broadcast messages and precise LEO orbits. The results show that the B-spline requires a moderate increase in message length as compared to the GPS broadcast. Additionally, the work shows that the B-spline representation can achieve varying levels of fit accuracy, ranging from 1 m to 5 cm.},

  abstract = {The GPS Antenna Characterization Experiment (GPS ACE) has made extensive observations of GPS L1 signals received at geosynchronous (GEO) altitude, with the objective of developing comprehensive models of the signal levels and signal performance in the GPS transmit antenna side lobes. The experiment was originally motivated by the fact that data on the characteristics and performance of the GPS signals available in GEO and other high Earth orbits was limited. The lack of knowledge of the power and accuracy of the side lobe signals on-orbit added risk to missions seeking to employ the side lobes to meet navigation requirements or improve performance. The GPS ACE Project filled that knowledge gap through a collaboration between The Aerospace Corporation and NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center to collect and analyze observations from GPS side lobe transmissions to a satellite at GEO using a highly-sensitive GPS receiver installed at the ground station. The GPS ACE architecture has been in place collecting observations of the GPS constellation with extreme sensitivity for several years. This sensitivity combined with around-the-clock, all-in-view processing enabled full azimuthal coverage of the GPS transmit gain patterns over time to angles beyond 90 degrees off-boresight. Results discussed in this paper include the reconstructed transmit gain patterns, with comparisons to available pre-flight gain measurements from the GPS vehicle contractors. For GPS blocks with extensive ground measurements, the GPS ACE results show remarkable agreement with ground based measurements. For blocks without extensive ground measurements, the GPS ACE results provide the only existing assessments of the full transmit gain patterns. The paper also includes results of pseudorange deviation analysis to assess systematic errors associated with GPS side lobe signals.},

Typically, these problems necessitates the introduction of large smoothing propagation errors to ensure stability and to avoid converging on false results.

  abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) autonomous approaching and landing on mobile platforms always play an important role in various application scenarios. Such a complicated autonomous task requires an integrated multi-sensor system to guarantee environmental adaptability in contrast to using each sensor individually. Multi-sensor fusion perception demonstrates great feasibility to compensate for adverse visual events, undesired vibrations of inertia sensors, and satellite positioning loss. In this paper, a UAV autonomous landing scheme based on multi-sensor fusion is proposed. In particular, Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) sensor, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and vision feedback are integrated to guide the UAV to approach and land on a moving object. In the approaching stage, a UWB-IMU-based sensor fusion algorithm is proposed to provide relative position estimation of vehicles with real time and high consistency. Such a sensor integration addresses the open challenge of inaccurate satellite positioning when the UAV is near the ground. It can also be extended to satellite-denied environmental applications. When the landing platform is detected by the onboard camera, the UAV performs autonomous landing. In the landing stage, the vision sensor is involved. With the visual feedback, a deep-learning-based detector and local pose estimator are enabled when the UAV approaches the landing platform. To validate the feasibility of the proposed autonomous landing scheme, both simulation and real-world experiments in extensive scenes are performed. As a result, the proposed landing scheme can land successfully with adequate accuracy in most common scenarios.},

Three frequency combinations, L1 only, L1 and L2, and widelane are implemented and tested over different baseline lengths. GPS only solutions and GPS/BeiDou solutions are compared. The availability and geometry, the accuracy of float and fixed positioning solution, and the time to fix the ambiguities are presented and analyzed.

One issue to address is how to dynamically deploy a wireless localization system in a positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) deficient area without positioning signal coverage in application scenarios such as cave exploration and emergency rescue situations. In order to support the task of dynamic deployment, this paper proposes a localization system based on wireless sensor networks (WSN). The proposed system is composed of two parts: a management center and a WSN. Using the proposed delay corrected extended Kalman filter (DCEKF) algorithm, the hardware delay bias correction and the localization and tracking of each node are realized. It is proved by numerical simulation and hardware experiments that the system can obtain high-precision positioning and tracking results of nodes in the process of dynamic deployment in PNT deficient areas with great robustness and flexibility.},

  abstract = {This work addresses the problem of communicationbased autonomous vehicle cooperative inertial navigation and localization in GPS-challenged environments. Specifically, we examine decentralized state estimation strategies that allow vehicles to opportunistically augment their onboard navigation filters with moving maps obtained from exchanged relative sensing and dynamic target tracking information between vehicles. While decentralized state estimation theoretically allows agents to share information efficiently with one another in a scalable, asynchronous, and ad hoc manner, several key technical issues arise. Firstly, augmentation of each vehicles navigation filters for decentralized estimation requires maintaining correlations between ownship vehicle pose states, ownship nuisance states (e.g. rate gyro biases), and pose states for all other tracked vehicles; this leads to expensive and unscalable onboard filtering requirements. Secondly, the use of distinct strapdown navigation and target tracking models onboard each vehicle implies that decentralized state estimation must occur across heterogeneous state space models; this case is usually not handled by conventional decentralized estimation theory. We present two novel strategies for addressing these problems in the context of cooperative navigation: the approximate channel filter, and factorized covariance intersection. We provide simulated examples to illustrate these approaches in simplified and realistic cooperative navigation settings, including a cooperative UAVUGV navigation application based on recorded UAV flight data.},

  abstract = {This paper analyzes the impact of the transmission of Non-Standard Coarse Acquisition Code (NSC) broadcast by the Global Positioning System (GPS), focusing on the impact on Galileo signals and receivers. The purpose is to present a comprehensive analysis on the NSC transmitted by the SVN49/NAVSTAR 63 satellite of the GPS constellation, starting from May 2017. Simulation results are presented with the aim to assess whether or not the NSC affects the reception of Galileo E1 Open Service (OS) and GPS L1 C/A signals. Though the impact of the NSC is as expected of small entity, the effects on the Galileo signals result bigger than those on the GPS ones. The paper concludes with a proposal for a modified structure of the NSC, that possibly brings to negligible interference effects also on the Galileo signals.},

These new data are ground-based 630 nm Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) measurements in the equatorial and polar regions, as well as cross-track winds from the Gravity Field and Steady State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite. The GOCE wind observations provide valuable wind data in the twilight regions. The ground-based FPI measurements fill latitudinal data gaps in the prior observational database. Construction of this reference model also provides the opportunity to compare these new measurements. The resulting update (HWM14) provides an improved time-dependent, observationally based, global empirical specification of the upper atmospheric general circulation patterns and migrating tides. In basic agreement with existing accepted theoretical knowledge of the thermosphere general circulation, additional calculations indicate that the empirical wind specifications are self-consistent with climatological ionosphere plasma distribution and electric field patterns.},

  abstract = {In this paper the potential benefits of an additional signal component in the Galileo E1 band are investigated for the use of carrier phase ambiguity resolution being the key to fast and high-precision positioning. High accuracy within short time is achievable by incorporation of carrier phase ambiguities and constraining them to integer values. Thus, the improvement of the integer ambiguity resolution is the main goal of this research. Figure of merit for the analysis is the probability of correct integer ambiguity resolution, the so called success rate. Several signal options for E1 are explored including multi-carrier signals and meta signal processing. We consideri E1 only processing and E1+E5a processing. The analysis considers a full constellation and computes the success rate averaged over the whole Earth’s surface for various C/N0 values. Multipath is not considered in this work but a range of values for the differential ionospheric delay. We find that one additional component provides a significant increase in the success rate (for E1 and E1+E5a processing). The gain is higher, if the frequency separation to the central frequency of E1 gets higher. Further signal components in the same E1 frequency range do not provide any further gain under the constraint of equal total power.},

The accuracy is mainly determined by the signal bandwidth and multipath propagation condition. Instead of occupying an enormous signal bandwidth, aggregating multiple signal bands, which are transmitted either simultaneously or sequentially from the same transmitter, can still provide a very high time resolution due to its large virtual signal bandwidth. This paper discusses time delay estimation based on multiband signals, considering precision, range ambiguity and resistance to multipath. Combining carrier phases from different bands, which are physically not perturbed by a sampling frequency offset, can also mitigate the bias of time delay estimation due to the sampling frequency error. Simulation results show that using two groups of multiband signals, which are sparsely placed in the signal spectrum, can significantly improve the accuracy of time delay estimation in the presence of multipath and sampling frequency offset.},

In this paper, we propose using 5G positioning techniques and collaborative localization to accurately estimate the locations of first responders located inside the building using outdoor UAV-mounted base stations (BSs) serving as anchors. For this setup, we perform a comprehensive Crame´r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) based analysis to evaluate the performance of position estimation in 3D and to examine the sensitivity of the localization performance to different system parameters. Our analysis considers various system parameters: dynamic line-of-sight (LOS)/non-line-of-sight (NLOS) characteristics of the channel, geometry of the anchors, number of anchors, number of LOS anchors, NLOS bias between an anchor and a target node, and between target nodes, anchor location uncertainty, and synchronization errors among anchors. Our analysis uses time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA), and timeof-arrival (TOA) based positioning methods assuming both LOS and NLOS propagation. Through our analysis, we identify the system parameters that most significantly impact the localization performance as well as the scenarios that provide location accuracy or position error bound (PEB) on the order of 2m and 3m.},

Studies have shown how the spatial variations of electron density in the ionosphere, affects measurements with network-Real Time Kinematic (NRTK) (Emardson et al 2011). This paper aims to predict what can be expected from measurements during the next solar maximum that is expected to occur around 2025 and discusses how it would affect RTK for automated transport applications. The ionospheric activity and its impact on positioning in the coming solar cycle maximum is discussed. This study focuses on data from Kiruna in northern Sweden (67.8N), mainly captured in January 2014 – in the middle of the most active time during the last cycle – which has been analyzed to predict the coming solar cycle. Based on the data, it was concluded that there is a risk of occasions with simultaneous signal slips on several satellites caused by the ionosphere which could cause temporary (minutes) loss of positioning ability for the RTK equipment. It is expected to occur a couple of times per month during the most active months of the solar cycle.},

While differential processing removes the effects of most common-mode error sources, it provides limited compensation for distortions caused by multipath or pseudorange measurement biases from dissimilar receiver hardware due to subtle space vehicle-borne signal deformations. These naturally occurring phenomena directly impact system integrity and lead to ranging error in the GNSS receiver solution. Signal Quality Monitoring (SQM) has the objective of providing confidence in the GNSS Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) solution, and aims to offer timely warning in the event that SV signal conditions degrade to unsafe levels.},

  abstract = {One of the main challenges of GNSS receivers is the provision of a effective solution for low-power devices. This is driven by the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which are low-power by nature. Furthermore, the complimentarity with telecommunication systems is another characteristic of IoT devices. Satellite communications is a solution that has started to be considered by the IoT industry. In particular, low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations are appearing for broadband IoT connectivity. In this paper, we consider a Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation as a possible approach to enable positioning with LEO satellites. The use of CSS is intended to address low complexity and low consumption positioning for IoT devices, tackling the complexity issue of the classic direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) acquisition. Indeed, CSS has been considered as possible candidate for low-power LEO satellite communications due to its resistance to Doppler effect. The target is to use CSS for ranging and low-power communications, as well as to exploit the properties of CSS to design a very simple, thus low-cost and low-power receiver. The study will address also possible approaches to obtain multi-satellite access. The idea is to get advantage of the work already done in radar and low-range communications with CSS and apply it to the design of a new CSS-based PNT signal for LEO satellites. A preliminary design of the considered CSS schemes for a LEO constellation will be provided in this paper. This design will be the base for a complexity analysis of the proposed CSS design as well as for the comparison with the classic DSSS signal.},

  abstract = {Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and autonomous vehicles need accurate localization solutions for applications such as lane identification and collision avoidance. Accuracy at the sub-metre level with 100\% availability and integrity above 99\% are desired. At present, no single positioning sensor can meet these requirements. In this study, continuous positioning is obtained by using GNSS-RTK with MEMS IMU and vehicle odometer. For journey planning, a new approach is presented to choose the route with best positioning performance, where positioning integrity, availability and precision along different possible routes are predicted. Prediction of the satellites in view is performed using 3D city models. A method is presented for computation of the Protection Levels (PL), which bound the position errors along the direction of motion of the vehicle and for the cross-track direction. In the case of actual navigation, the Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) process in integrity monitoring (IM) includes applying the Chi-square test for detection of faults and identification is performed using the w-test, both are applied in the observation domain. The exclusion of observations is confirmed using the solution-separation method, performed in the position domain. A new test defined as ‘FIT” is presented, which checks the impact of the remaining measurement and system errors after the FDE on the final position. The proposed methods are demonstrated through a kinematic test run in an urban area, which represents a challenging environment for ITS applications. The predicted positioning metrics were compared with their values computed from the actual test data. Results show that the 3D map-aided method is able to reasonably predict satellite visibility, and accordingly aid prediction of the integrity, availability and precision. However, it was optimistic in some sections of the road. When using RTK, tight PLs were produced and an alert limit of 1.0 m can be implemented with IM availability of 99\%. The use of IMU+vehicle odometer computes the time-change in positioning, hence, their biases accumulate with time and their use in bridging RTK positioning should be limited to short periods.},

  abstract = {Improved SBAS is expected to be a primary positioning method for many land applications such as Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). In 2017, a second-generation SBAS test-bed was initiated in Australia and New-Zealand in preparation for building an operational system. In addition to the traditional L1 legacy SBAS signals, the Australian/NZ SBAS provides dual-frequency multiconstellation (DFMC) SBAS signals and SBAS-based PPP service for GPS and Galileo observations. This article addresses the use of SBAS in land applications from three important aspects. Firstly, the performance of the different SBAS solution methods is assessed in two main applications, transportation and mining. Tests were conducted under various environments, including open sky, low- and high-density urban, and mining. Performance analysis showed that SBAS solutions provide better positioning than single point positioning, and the DFMC SBAS solutions have better precision than L1 SBAS solutions. Furthermore, SBAS-based PPP solutions delivered a few-dm accuracy, which is a bit worse than traditional PPP with corrections received via the Internet. It is shown that SBAS performance is strongly dependent on the application environment. Secondly, tests show that SBAS outages may occur in urban areas, thus, the paper proposed prediction of the SBAS orbit and clock corrections as time series to enable positioning. The orbits are predicted using Holt-Winters’ method and clock corrections were predicted using a second order polynomial with sinusoidal components. A position error due to prediction grow with time, but was less than 0.26m after 15 minutes of prediction. Finally, the impact of SBAS outages on computation of the protection levels (PL) needed for integrity monitoring of the new DFMC SBAS is illustrated. It is shown that Horizontal-PLs can reach more than 10 m, which is not suitable for ITS when the previous SBAS parameters before the outage were used, and thus methods are proposed for future research.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have evolved into an alternative to traditional mapping platforms for some applications due to their flexibility and cost savings. Most UAVs, which are used as mobile mapping systems (MMS), depend on utilizing position and orientation system (POS) onboard the platform. Usually, POS consists of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) as a positioning sensor integrated with an Inertial Navigation System (INS), which encompasses Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) as an orientation sensor. This GNSS/INS integration is usually performed in either a loosely coupled (LC) or a tightly coupled (TC) scheme. Although LC is a simple scheme that uses the GNSS solutions to aid the INS navigation, TC has the advantage of being able to integrate raw GNSS measurements and INS when less than four GNSS satellites are tracked, which makes it a better candidate for more MMS applications. However, for some environments with large GNSS outages, especially where no satellites are tracked, TC architecture is still not a convenient solution, even with using smoothers afterward.},

  abstract = {The received GNSS signals have very low signal power due to traveling a long distance and the nature of the signal’s propagation medium. This makes them readily susceptible to signal interference. The GNSS signal interference could be unintentional, e.g., interfering the signal with other signals in the same Radio Frequency (RF) band or due to multipath. Alternatively, on the contrary, the signal interference could be deliberate—commonly called signal jamming. Signal jamming is an increasing worldwide problem that causes degradation or interruption in GNSS position, navigation, and timing (PNT) services. The objectives of this research are evaluating the impact of linear chirp jamming on commercial GNSS receivers and investigating the benefits of using combined GPS/GLONASS systems on navigation solution under such circumstances. The Spirent GSS6700 simulator combined with an interference signal generator was used to evaluate the performance of both NovAtel ProPak-G2 Plus and OEMV receivers under linear chirp jamming scenario. The signal power degradation, navigation solution availability, positioning accuracy and dilution of precision (DOP) were used as evaluation metrics for receivers’ performance assessment. Solutions that comprised both GPS and GLONASS systems provided a significant improvement in all the performance measures mentioned earlier.},

  abstract = {The mitigation of radio frequency interference (RFI) has been always one of the major concerns for the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) community. Despite the narrowband jamming immunity gained by spreading and despreading processes in direct sequence spread spectrum employed in global positioning system (GPS). The fact that GPS signals travel a very long distance and reach the receiver with a very low power makes it vulnerable to intentional and non-intentional interference. The presence of a jamming signal affects the acquisition, tracking and navigation modules inside the receiver leading to loss-of-lock of the signals. Consequently, GPS receivers fail to provide reliable position, velocity, and timing solutions. The paper focuses on an innovative narrowband jamming mitigation technique based on the wavelet packet transform (WPT). The proposed technique is implemented in a vector tracking-based software GNSS receiver, and test trajectories are generated using Spirent GSS6700 GNSS Simulation System. Simulation results showing the benefits of the proposed wavelet-based mitigation technique on the acquisition and navigation stages are presented.},

Due to the dynamic nature of these diseases the filter is designed to handle very large rotation rates. The algorithm fuses data from low-cost gyroscopes and accelerometers. It tracks attitude using quaternion error states and is able to dynamically track the gyroscope bias - allowing the filter to be used in a commercial application without calibration. The filter is tested using a MATLAB simulation as well as with a mechanical test rig. During testing with the mechanical rig the rotation rates of the limb exceed 260 degrees per second and the filter is able to maintain an RMS error of less than 1 degree.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces an odometry-like front-end estimator for GPS-denied fixed-wing flight using a monocular camera. This development is a critical component for enabling fixed-wing aircraft to use a novel methodology called relative navigation. Relative navigation allows a single vehicle to gracefully accommodate intermittent GPS or geo-registered image updates. It can also enable communication and a computationally feasible cooperative, batch-based navigation approach for numerous vehicles. This paper presents a visual-odometry estimator that is appropriate for fixed-wing flight characteristics and sensing requirements. We propose a modification to the multi-state-constraint Kalman filter which, instead of running the filter in a single inertial/global frame, regularly resets the navigation frame to a new local origin. The vehicle operates based on the most recent keyframe and produces a marginalized change in pose (odometry) and covariance output whenever the keyframe is updated. This allows the front end to operate at the IMU rate to accommodate guidance and control inputs while sharing marginalized keyframe-to-keyframe odometry estimates with a back-end, graph optimization at a much lower rate than traditional batch navigation schemes. Results from testing the proposed method in a high-fidelity simulation of the filter is also presented.},

  abstract = {Recently, there has been a growing demand for high-precision smartphone positioning. GNSS positioning is typically the core of precise positioning algorithms in many applications. However, smartphone GNSS receivers suffer from the low availability of dual-frequency observations. Additionally, smartphones' low quality and noisy GNSS observations made their positioning solution vulnerable to cycle slip, multipath, and solution discontinuity. Therefore, GNSS needs to be aided by other sensors to assure the solution continuity and keep the accuracy within acceptable limits. This study develops a tightly-coupled integration of GNSS precise point positioning (PPP) and the reduced inertial sensor system (RISS) to provide a reliable positioning solution in challenging GNSS environments. The results showed that the developed PPP/RISS solution smoothed the spikes in the PPP solution where the cycle slips are detected. Additionally, the tightly-coupled integration improved the accuracy of the positioning solution.},

  abstract = {In recent years, single-frequency Precise Point Positioning (SF-PPP) has become an interesting research topic as most of the low-cost GNSS receivers in the mass market are only providing single-frequency observations. SF-PPP can provide sub-meter accuracy in benign GNSS conditions; however, this accuracy degrades in challenging environments where the GNSS signal is degraded or totally blocked. For a reliable and continuous navigation solution, SF-PPP is integrated with an Inertial Measurements System (INS). This paper presents a low-cost PPP/INS integrated navigation solution targeted for land vehicular navigation. The INS utilizes a full MEMS Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to achieve the target low-cost requirements. To tackle the problem of INS drift errors, the system depends on utilizing the PPP accuracy and applying a reliable estimation algorithm. In normal conditions, SF-PPP precise solution dominates the overall system performance. Moreover, it leads to faster convergence and more accurate estimation of IMU sensors biases. The correct estimation of the IMU biases is a vital factor for the integrated system performance in challenging environments and long GNSS outages. The system is evaluated through two road tests which included open-sky, sub-urban, momentary outages, and complete GNSS outage conditions. The results show that the presented PPP/INS maintained horizontal sub-meter rms accuracy in open-sky and sub-urban conditions with results comparable to the u-blox untethered dead reckoning solution (UDR). In a complete GNSS outage of 3 min, in an underground parking, the presented system outperformed the UDR solution and showed a better long-term performance. The presented system is expected to benefit low-cost precise land vehicle navigation applications.},

  abstract = {Precise point positioning (PPP) provides a precise navigation solution with world-wide coverage using a single GNSS receiver. Single-frequency (SF) PPP has gained more interest in the recent years because of the low-cost of SF-GNSS receivers and their wide applications in the mass market. Real-time SF-PPP is now possible with the availability of both commercial and free real-time precise augmentation corrections. The two major sources of freely available real-time corrections are International GNSS Service real-time service (IGS-RTS) and GNSS augmentation systems such as the satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS). Profound Positioning Inc. (PPI) has developed a real-time SF-PPP technology known as “Instant PPP”. This paper demonstrates the capability of the instant PPP technology to work with the freely available real-time PPP corrections through static and kinematic analysis. The instant PPP was tested with corrections from two different IGS-RTS streams and two SBAS systems. The static test utilized six IGS stations located in North America, Europe and Asia. Furthermore, a kinematic road test is carried out in a suburban area with several overpass bridges. The results from both static and kinematic tests showed that instant PPP with precise corrections can achieve half-meter level horizontal accuracy and one-meter accuracy in the vertical direction in static and suburban scenarios.},

While outdoor positioning is perfectly covered by Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), indoor positioning services, except for a few pioneer projects, did not hit the mainstream yet. At first, this is surprising, as the underlying technology has been known for years and solutions already exist based on WiFi or Bluetooth beacons. A major problem is, that the locations of those beacons need to be highly tailored to the specific indoor floorplan for high positioning accuracies, which directly contradicts the need for a cheap installment. Picking up this challenge, we present a methodology for fast optimization of access point locations in indoor environments, maximizing coverage and positioning accuracy that will facilitate a broad deployment of indoor positioning systems.},

The received signal expressions in the Doppler-delay (DD) are derived when the system experiences the effects of near-field or far-field propagation. Utilizing these received signal expressions and the Fisher information matrix (FIM), we derive the fundamental localization error limits of a user equipment (UE) that receives signals in the DD domain after reflections from the RISs. Through simulations, we show that the localization error decreases with the number of receive antennas and RIS elements. Subsequently, we note that RISs can become misoriented, i.e., their orientations can be disturbed after initial deployment. Hence, we investigate the possibility of exploiting the signals received at the UE in the DD domain to estimate the RIS orientation. Our simulation results indicate that the orientation of a certain RIS can only be estimated when the UE is experiencing the effects of near-field propagation with respect to that RIS. Through simulations, we show that a fundamental drawback of RISaided localization of a UE is that the RIS orientation offset is detrimental to the localization error of the UE.},

The software-defined modules that enhance the capability of COTS signal generator here are chosen to be a software-based signal generator which derives highly precise and proven signal generation capabilities from the existing vector tracking architecture in an advanced software receiver MuSNAT (Multi-Sensor Navigation Analysis Tool). However, the signal generation is limited at the level of producing IF samples and requires translation to RF level to assist complete end to end receiver testing. On the other hand, COTS signal generators are devices that are proven to generate high quality RF signals under different test standards but still lack a deeper level of adaptability. A solution that bridges both the requirements of the software and COTS signal generators is the introduction of a file-based interface between a software signal generator capable of generating measurement-level signal samples and COTS signal generator. The RF signal generated through the file-based interface is investigated under different receiver dynamics and multipath conditions against a reference COTS signal generator and IF-level software signal generator.},

  abstract = {The modernized GPS satellites, Block IIR-M, and follow-on GPS satellites, Block IIF, can redistribute the transmit power between the signal components. This is called flex power and it has been developed as a remedy against jamming. From January 2017 until February 13, 2020, a flex power was active which was centered at 41°E and 37°N for only Block IIF satellites. On February 14, 2020, a new flex power mode is activated on both GPS Block IIR-M and Block IIF satellites centered at 37ºE/35ºN and 69ºE/35ºN. The changes in the transmit power affect the carrier-to-noise density ratio (C/N0) observations as well as the differential code bias (DCB) estimations. To see the impact of the flex power on DCB estimations, first DCBs are calculated without considering these changes. Next, a second DCB estimation is done by considering the flex power into the calculations. This time, two different DCBs are estimated for the satellite when it is inside and outside of the flex power activation area. The extension of this area is identified by analyzing flex power induced discontinuities in carrier-to-noise density ratio observations. In order to reduce the effects of the different front-end and correlator settings on estimated DCBs, a global network of exclusively Septentrio PolaRx5 and PolaRx5TR receivers is used and the results are compared with each other. Additionally, a global network of Javad receivers is used and compared with Septentrio PolaRx5 and PolaRx5TR to study the impact of using different the receivers on DCB estimations.},

  abstract = {SAR systems inherently generate highly valuable navigation data at very high rates. However, this information is usually totally ignored by the platform’s ad-hoc navigation system required by SAR data processing methods. On this behalf, a scheme that takes advantage of SAR data richness in a post processed INS/GPS/SAR integrated navigation method is here proposed. The new method, not only may considerably improve the navigation accuracy, but it also allows for geo-coding of highlighted points of the scene being imaged (geo-coding that could easily be propagated to the rest of the SAR image) by using only flight data. Potential applications are geodesy and geo-location, roads and civil works, ducts and transmission lines supervision and cadastre. For ease of reading, the article summarizes the basis of SAR processing.},

Thanks to those, the system has the capability to correct possible data navigation errors, which potentially induces delays in first fix of the receiver. In the GNSS receivers, those error correcting schemes use the Log Likelihood Ratio (LLR) as the input of the decoding algorithm. Until now, the LLR was always computed under the Gaussian assumption and considering perfect Complete State Information (CSI), which does not hold in most of the real scenarios. Then; in this paper we proposed several methods to compute the LLR, considering a set of realitic scenarios and considering that perfect CSI is not available at the receiver. We test the proposed LLRs for several new generation GNSS signals.},

These methods are designed for a resilient GNSS system that is being developed to mitigate GNSS spoofing and jamming by using signals from a small antenna array which consists of a set of patch antennas arranged in a “bug-eye” shape. The spoofing classification method of the present paper operates on the DoA outputs of the various signals’ trackers. The new method also uses the trackers’ computed estimation error covariances for their DoA estimates. The contribution of this paper is a multi-hypothesis test that considers all possible hypotheses about the authentic and spoofed sets of tracked signals. A combinatorial analysis is performed in order to generate all possible authentic-set/spoofed-set classifications for the given set of tracked signals and determine the correct authentic set among the different combinations. Results from Monte Carlo runs show that using DoA methods is suitable for determining the correct combinations, assuming there is large direction separation between the authentic GNSS signals and the spoofed signals. However, when using DoA and pseudorange techniques one can determine the correct combination regardless of the direction separations. Results also indicated that the assumptions made during the paper can be relaxed in order to successfully handle other scenarios, such as multiple directional spoofers.},

CHIMERA is designed to authenticate incoming GPS signals through two methods referred to as the fast and slow channels. This paper analyzes the accuracy of estimation algorithms for both of these channels when using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to compensate for authentication delay, and it considers the effects of different quality IMUs. This paper also introduces a concept of authentication staggering as a possible approach to improve location and attitude accuracy. The estimation algorithm is modified to account for authentication staggering and different possible estimation architectures are developed for this purpose. The results indicate that the fast channel produces typical GPS navigation accuracy for different quality IMUs while the slow channel has moderately degraded navigation accuracy even with a navigation-grade IMU and highly degraded accuracy with tactical- and MEMS-grade IMUs. Staggering the authentication times of the GPS satellites can be used to improve navigation accuracy for the slow channel.},

Analysis is done both locally, i.e. at a particular location on the Earth, and globally, i.e. at all locations on the Earth, for an instance in time. Analysis is also performed to consider the evolution of uncertainty through time and consider different grade Inertial Measurement Units (IMU). Results indicate significant improvement in uncertainty when considering authentication staggering in general, while also indicating that using the largest number of authentication groups possible is often preferred. Using this information, one can expect position uncertainty of 1-2 meters for a navigation grade IMU, and 10-45 meters for a tactical grade IMU.},

  abstract = {A new vector loop has been developed to track code phase, beat carrier phase, carrier Doppler shift, amplitude, polarization, and Direction of Arrival (DoA) using GNSS signals from a small multi-element antenna array. Each antenna will have two feeds, one primarily sensitive to Right-Hand Circularly Polarized (RHCP) signals and one sensitive to Left-Hand Circularly Polarized (LHCP) signals. The antenna system and vector tracking loop have been designed to be part of a system that ensures resilient Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) in the presence of GNSS jammers and spoofers. The tracking loop uses an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) implemented in Square Root Information Filter (SRIF) form. The Kalman filter is augmented to provide Delay Lock Loop (DLL) and Phase Lock Loop (PLL) feedback estimates for the receiver to use in its standard code and carrier mixing operations. Measurement input data to the Kalman filter takes the form of early, prompt, and late In-Phase and Quadrature accumulations. Tracking occurs downstream of a blind null steering algorithm and after signal acquisition. The Kalman filter’s model of the accumulation measurements is specially tailored to include the distortion effects of the upstream blind null steering operations. A Multiple Model Filter (MMF) is used, as needed, to account for large uncertainties in initial DoA estimates from a fine acquisition calculation. The performance of the Kalman filter tracking loop is analyzed using simulations in which multiple jammers yield a net isotropic J/S of 82 dB. Results show convergence within 1-2 σ bounds for all elements of interest, except for the signal amplitude which exhibits a bias. Typical code-phase tracking steady-state accuracies are 1 m, carrier phase accuracies are .05 rad, carrier Doppler shift accuracies are .6 Hz, and DoA accuracies are .5 deg.},

Each spacecraft transmits two signals to the other spacecraft, a PRN code modulated on a 2 GHz carrier (S-band), as well as an unmodulated carrier at roughly 33 GHz (Ka-band). Since it’s not feasible to synchronize the two GRAIL spacecraft’s clocks via GPS (as was done with GRACE [3] [4], a Earth-gravity mission launched in 2002), the S-band signals are used as a timetransfer link to synchronize either Ebb’s clock to Flow or vice versa.},

A nonlinear complementary filter is proposed that combines accelerometer output for low frequency attitude estimation with integrated gyrometer output for high frequency estimation. The raw accelerometer output includes a component corresponding to airframe acceleration, occurring primarily when the aircraft turns, as well as the gravitational acceleration that is required for the filter. The airframe acceleration is estimated using a simple centripetal force model (based on additional airspeed measurements), augmented by a first order dynamic model for angle-of-attack, and used to obtain estimates of the gravitational direction independent of the airplane manoeuvres. Experimental results are provided on a real-world data set and the performance of the filter is evaluated against the output from a full GPS/INS that was available for the data set.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a demonstration of the open-source RTKLIB software as used to compete in the 2022 Google smartphone decimeter challenge (GSDC). The GSDC is a competition where raw GNSS observation data from Android smartphones is provided to be processed to generate the most accurate determination of longitude and latitude. This solution is based on the capability of RTKLIB to run post-processed kinematic (PPK) solutions on raw GNSS observation data. The goals of this effort were to demonstrate the capability of the RTKLIB software to provide comparatively high accuracy solutions for smartphone data, to provide an easily reproducible result that can be used as a starting point for other GNSS research, and to set a benchmark for a conventional solution with incremental improvement that can be used to help assess the effectiveness of more novel approaches from other competitors. Although PPK positioning solutions are expected to provide centimeter level accuracy when used with high quality data from commercial GNSS receivers, the lower quality of the Android measurements means this level of accuracy is difficult or impossible to achieve. Additionally, the default configurations and methodologies of the RTKLIB solutions are optimized for higher quality measurements. Hence, multiple changes were required to both the RTKLIB code and configuration files to optimize the solutions for smartphone measurements. Previously it was demonstrated, after the 2021 GSDC challenge had completed, that a version of RTKLIB optimized for smartphone measurements would have resulted in a fifth place finish in that competition. This paper uses that solution as a starting point and extends it to further improve position accuracy for this year’s data. These results achieved sixth place in the 2022 competition and a more recent variation of this solution achieved a score within 1 cm of the third place solution.},

Landmark initialization is a critical process of SLAM algorithm, which is registering features to the map by estimating their position. Due to scale ambiguity, precise undelayed landmark initialization may not be possible by using monocular 2D vision sensor. Although several delayed initialization methods have been proposed and used, number of observed frames of a scene does not suffice to both determine the position of landmarks accurately and aid INS for high speed airborne platforms with a 2D narrow field of view vision sensor. To achieve precise mapping of features and localization simultaneously within a few frames, we further develop LRF assisted visual SLAM which estimates the position of newly detected landmarks instantaneously providing more accurate updates to INS sooner. Fusing LRF and optical measurements improved accuracy of navigation solution by more than 95 percent over INS only mode for 15 minutes flight simulations.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to present and discuss the results of a Spoofing Detection and Direction Finding procedure usable for GNSS spoofing monitoring on board of a commercial aircraft. The targeted use case is an evolution of the GNSS equipment used on board of civil aircrafts, characterized by the availability of more GNSS constellations (multi-constellation) and two carrier frequencies (dual-frequency). The GNSS evolution in the civil aviation domain also foresees the progressive acquisition of a prominent role for GNSS in the aircraft navigation system, while today this role is taken by the traditional terrestrial NavAids. In such a scenario, the safe management of the Radio Frequency (RF) interference risk on GNSS becomes a primary task; nonetheless, the strict regulatory and certification procedures of the civil aviation domain impose a smooth technological evolution for the onboard avionic systems and consequent constraints in the design of new functionalities.},

  abstract = {The European Rail Traffic Management System/European Train Control System (ERTMS/ETCS) has been developed by the European Union to enhance safety and efficiency of the railway transportation. So far, the positioning and monitoring of the trains have been based mainly on trackside equipment named balises: the introduction of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) to implement an absolute positioning system on trains could lead to a better utilization of the line with a consequent line capacity increase, along with reliability increasing and cost reducing due to the removal of expensive infrastructures. This paper describes the insertion of a state-of-the-art channel model, named Land Mobile Satellite Channel Model (LMSCM) properly adapted to represent railways scenarios, into a hardware-in-the-loop system, where the parameters generated by LMSCM are used to configure an RF GNSS signal generator. The use of the hardware generator eases the simulation of the entire GNSS constellation, while the availability of the RF signal enables the assessment of the effects of rail-domain multipath on commercial receivers. The resulting model, named Rail-Land Mobile Satellite Channel Model (Rail-LMSCM), has been enhanced with the support of different kind of scenarios a train may encounter around the rail track, as well as with the introduction of GNSS outages due to the presence of tunnels. Such enhancements make the RailLMSCM a more realistic average representation of the railway environment. The implemented Rail-LMSCM has been used to test in the lab the local propagation effects on the performance of a complete GNSS receiver.},

  abstract = {Signal fading is the main disturbing phenomenon for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers in urban environment, which induces frequent loss of carrier lock in GNSS phase tracking loops. By taking advantage of the prevalent configuration of multi-frequency reception in emerging GNSS receivers, this paper proposes a Frequency Diversity combined GNSS carrier Tracking Loop (FDTL) for robust and centimeter-level positioning under harsh propagation conditions. Specifically, a bank of correlators is used to estimate the signal parameters of interest with a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) discriminator to avoid the need for a separate acquisition which normally requires the most processing time in GNSS receivers. The Doppler relationship between multifrequency signals offers an inherent constraint which is used to improve accuracy of MLE measurements. In the loop tuning process, a frequency diversity combined Adaptive Kalman Filter (AKF) is implemented for system dynamic propagation and measurement update. The primary advantages of the proposed FDTL algorithm include: 1) significantly improved carrier tracking robustness compared with traditional Phase Lock Loops (PLLs); 2) enhanced sensitivity obtained from the diversity combination. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated by simulated and real GNSS fading signals.},

  abstract = {NASA, in the frame of the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative, has established a partnership with the Italian Space Agency (ASI) to procure a commercial GNSS payload for the Lunar GNSS Receiver Experiment (LuGRE). The project main objective is to achieve GNSS-based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) on the Moon. By collecting GPS and Galileo raw measurements and IQ samples on both L1 and L5 bands, LuGRE will pave the way for the use of GNSS-based navigation systems in future moon missions. The LuGRE payload will fly on board the US Firefly Blue Ghost Mission 1 Lander (BGM1), landing on the Moon’s Mare Crisium in 2024. Moreover, the project oversees the development of a GNSS Software Defined Radio (SDR) receiver, which is a moon-customized version of Qascom QN400-SPACE. The receiver processor has been upgraded to support the mission operational modes for standard acquisition and tracking (i.e., Real Time Processing) and Sample Capture, which allows the collection of IQ samples batches for post-processing activities on-ground. High sensitivity acquisition and tracking techniques have been embedded to acquire and track GNSS signals as weak as 23 dB-Hz. Specialized navigation plugins have been added for Moon Transfer Orbit (MTO) and Moon Surface (MS) static positioning. The SDR technology allows for high flexibility and reconfigurability throughout the mission, during which Positioning and Timing are assisted with the uplink of GPS/Galileo ephemeris and time. The software can be incrementally updated via telecommand, and software-based radiation resilience mechanisms have been introduced to improve the robustness against memory corruptions. The payload includes a High-Gain Antenna (HGA) and a Front-End Assembly (FEA) containing a multi-stage Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) with dual-band filtering at L1 and L5. The High Gain Antenna consists in a passive RHCP L-band antenna obtained with a planar array of 3x3 elements operating in the L1/E1 and L5/E5a bands with a gain pattern up to 15dBi. After the HGA, the received signal is then processed through the LNA in the FEA, which boosts the signal power in order to properly feed the receiver stage.},

Early experimentation demonstrated that the low bandwidth of BLE signals compared to WiFi is the cause of significant measurement error when coupled with the use of three BLE advertising channels. The physics underlying this behaviour is verified in simulation. A multipath mitigation scheme is proposed and tested. It is determined that the optimal positioning performance is provided by 10Hz beaconing and a 1 second multipath mitigation processing window size. It is determined that a steady increase in positioning performance with fingerprint size occurs up to 7 ±1, above this there is no clear benefit to extra beacon coverage.},

We employed the concept of vanishing directions together with the orthogonality constraints of the man-made environments in an expectation maximization framework to estimate person’s orientation with respect to the known indoor coordinates from video frames. This framework allows to include prior information about camera rotation axis for better estimations as well as to select candidate edge-lines for estimation of hallways’ depth and width from monocular video frames, and 3D modeling of the scene. Our proposed algorithm concurrently combines the vision-based estimated orientation with the inertial data using a Kalman filter in order to refine estimations and remove substantial measurement drift from inertial sensors. We evaluated the performance of our vision-inertial data fusion method on an IMU-augmented video recorded from a rotary hallway in which a participant completed a full lap. We demonstrated that this fusion provides virtually drift-free instantaneous information about the person’s relative orientation. We were able to estimate hallways’ depth and width, and generate a closed-path map from the rotary hallway over a roughly 60-meter lap.},

  abstract = {In this study the concept of using GBAS corrections and integrity parameters for UAV operations is explored. The GBAS messages are received and decoded at the airport to overcome the issue of VDB coverage for alternative applications that do not have line-ofsight to the GBAS. A flight test at a distance of about 15 km from an operational GBAS ground station was conducted using a quadrotor UAV as test vehicle. The recorded GBAS messages and recorded pseudoranges and carrier phases were subsequently used to evaluate the performance that can be obtained. One main issue that was identified is the number of satellites lost when maneuvering the drone. Loss of tracking requires a re-initialization of the smoothing filter and thus entails a wait time before a satellite can be used for positioning again. The GBAS corrections are generated based on 100 s smoothing, requiring a user to use the same smoothing time constant do avoid potential differential error buildups due to different filters. Hence, the time until a satellite can be used again after reacquisition may be substantial. When losing several satellites simultaneously or shortly after another this decreases the number of available satellites significantly and negatively impacts accuracy and protection level performance of this proposed mode of operation. The paper also studies the multipath effect at different altitudes and for different smoothing time constants compared to the standardized error models that were defined for large transport aircraft. When using 100 s smoothing the results indicate that the models are suitable also for the use case of UAV operations.},

  abstract = {In this paper we show the results of flight testing the proposed GBAS Approach Service Type D navigation the service type intended to support autoland operations and compare its guidance capabilities to the performance of an ILS. The evaluations shown here are based on a flight test campaign carried out in 2011 and 2012. An experimental GBAS ground station consisting of three reference receivers was installed by DLR at the research airport in Braunschweig-Wolfsburg in northern Germany. Data processing in this station complies with the requirements to support the most stringent requirements for approaches and landings under CAT-II/III weather conditions. GPS pseudorange corrections and integrity parameters were calculated and sent to our research aircraft. We then processed the received navigation data from the experimental onboard GPS and applied the corrections and integrity parameters from the ground station. The obtained position was used to calculate ILSlike deviations which were displayed to the pilot. The base aircraft's measurement data (including actual ILS deviations) are available in our test aircraft. To evaluate system performance we created a truth reference trajectory from a post processed dual frequency carrier phase solution and compared the GBAS outputs and the received ILS signals to this reference. This setup allowed us to evaluate quality of the signals provided and compare performance of two systems under nominal conditions and with a representative aircraft. Results show that GBAS is well suited to support precision approach operations under such conditions. The experimental system was performing well within all limits and specifications and showed full availability at all times during the flight. While ILS errors reached up to about 8 meters for the glide slope and about 12 meters for the localizer signals, GBAS errors remained below one meter laterally and vertically at all times and provided a significantly less noisy guidance signal.},

  abstract = {Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) was originally proposed to identify potential faults by consistency checking of redundant measurements in one constellation (i.e. GPS). The limited number of visible satellites imposes constraints on the specification of RAIM algorithms, for example, assuming a single fault. As faults induced by local environments could be present in multiple measurements, the limited number of visible satellites from a single constellation makes it impossible to exclude multiple faults where the requirement for availability is the dominant factor.},

An implementation of each of them is described in detail for both Galileo HAS (High Accuracy Service), and QZSS (Quasi-Zenith Satellite System) CLAS (Centimeter-Level Accuracy Service). The performance of the schemes in terms of time to receive the corrections message, and increase in the age of data (AOD) due to authentication, is analyzed.

The wireless communication/navigation system will exchange data between different spacecraft (distributed architectures and sensors) and give the possibility to exploit the inherent redundancy inside a formation and the optimization of the resources (centralized Vs decentralized data processing). This is only possible with inter-satellite links with transmission rates in the order of Mbps. Ensuring a reliable inter-satellite navigation/communication link at high rate allows the formation to operate together as one "virtual satellite" and strengthens the ability of multiple small satellites flying in formation to perform missions traditionally carried out by single, larger satellites.},

The objective is to improve existing LDACS receiver algorithms towards a more robust computation of navigation observables at no loss in accuracy. Evaluating real flight data from the results of the ALPS project further supports previous claims that LDACS-based navigation will enable RNP 0.3 based on terrestrial ranging. In addition to the improved processing we propose a way of discriminating nominal and faulted measurements. With this screening method we produce the first-ever LDACS-based ranging data set made up of fault-free measurements. Finally, we compute an overbounding Gaussian error model, with a sigma σρ {$<$} 30 m, based on 102 million data samples.},

  abstract = {This paper treats the problem of tracking the global navigation satellite system’s (GNSS) signal phase under ionospheric scintillations and to generate an estimate of the scintillation phase and amplitude. In the case of ionospheric scintillations traditional phase locked loop (PLL) based GNSS receivers have problems to track the signal phase accurately. Moreover, these receivers do not estimate the scintillation phase and amplitude, which is evaluated in ionospheric monitoring applications. Therefore, Kalman filter based phase tracking algorithms have been proposed, which track line-of-sight (LOS) phase and scintillation amplitude and phase separately with different state space models. For modeling the scintillation phase and amplitude auto-regressive (AR) models can be used. In this case the parameters for the AR model have to be estimated together with the LOS and scintillation phase and amplitude. We propose to use a second Kalman filter for the estimation of the AR model parameters. This Kalman filter takes the scintillation phase and amplitude estimates from the first Kalman filter as measurement and the AR model parameters as system state. Simulation results for the global positioning system (GPS) show that the proposed algorithm achieves the same estimation performance for scintillation phase and amplitude as an algorithm with a priori knowledge on the AR model parameters.},

  abstract = {The spoofing attack is a well known threat for global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs), where a malicious entity forges fake GNSS signals in order to trick a victim receiver into computing the desired false position and time. Only in recent years the interest in anti-spoofing techniques has been extended to mobile-device applications. As location-based services (LBS) are now deeply integrated in billions of people’s everyday life, the security of positioning in mobile phones has become a concern. Indeed, it has been proven that even modern smartphones are vulnerable to position and time spoofing attacks. Previous studies have shown that current smartphones perform little or no cross-check on GNSS positioning, about the navigation message correctness, or the consistency of the obtained position estimate with data from other sensors that may be available on the same device. In this paper, as a response to the spoofing threat, we develop a novel technique that checks the consistency between the position estimates obtained by GNSS and data relative to the neighbouring cell. For the latter estimate we propose two solutions: one is based on the position of the base stations and the other directly on the smartphone position estimated from the cellular network. We also implement the proposed techniques in an Android application and test its effectiveness in detecting spoofing attacks and giving a warning to the user.},

  abstract = {Despite pedestrian and vehicle navigation are the key applications enabled by the development of GNSS technology, the best approach to obtain accurate, reliable, continuous and robust PVT (Position-Velocity-Timing) solutions for this purpose has yet to be identified. The real limiting factor is the environment in which the users usually navigate: e.g. multipath effects and cycle slips in harsh urban environments strongly affect, respectively, pseudorange measurements and the continuity of carrier-phase observations. Therefore, positioning services relying on code-based algorithms cannot always meet the required accuracy –which varies depending on the targeted use case –; on the other hand, phase-based approaches as Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) and Precise Point Positioning (PPP) require strong effort to deal with the ambiguity term and its reinitialization when cycle slips occur. These problems are amplified when GNSS measurements from Android smartphone are considered due to the low-cost, linearly polarized and multi-purpose antenna which inevitably impacts on the quality of GNSS observables. This paper focuses on the performance analysis of GNSS POWER - an algorithm based on the loosely coupling between Single Point Positioning (SPP) solutions and variometric velocity - combined with IGS SSR corrections to increase the accuracy achievable in a real-time stand-alone solution. The integration of SSR corrections within GNSS POWER algorithm is validated in both static and kinematic scenarios using high-end GNSS receivers and Andorid smartphones. The results demonstrated the advantages of using SSR corrections on SPP and GNSS POWER solutions also on Android devices opening to new applications of real-time stand-alone positioning approaches on mass-market devices.},

Known as The Whole Works, the algorithm was developed by The Whole Shebang as a solution to the Google Decimeter Accuracy Competition. The Competition provided a set of data collected from a vehicle driven around the San Francisco Bay area over multiple days using three different smartphones. The team placed 4th in the contest, out of 810 international teams, using an approach that maximised benefit of the GNSS and IMU sensors available on the mobile. The approach adopted a UKF as the core processor, employing also Huber-like readjustments, reverse smoothing, static vehicle detection and a series of pre- and post-processing steps to ensure only quality measurements and solutions were delivered by the algorithm. All typical environments were considered in testing the solution, including motorways, residential and urban areas. Significant benefits are derived by an appropriate inclusion of each step, where decimeter accuracies are retrieved on the smartphone device.},

  abstract = {Magnetometer calibration for shipboard detection of Earth magnetic field anomalies is commonly accomplished by estimating the vessel’s permanent and induced magnetic fields. Crustal anomalies cannot be accurately detected without accounting for the vessel’s magnetic signature. This paper proposes using the magnetometer to produce relative vice full magnetic field measurements to detect anomalies. Magnetometer calibration is performed in a two-step process; the magnetometer is zero referenced and then a maneuver is conducted to obtain sufficient observability of the induced magnetic field. Experimental data collected using a Diamond Nitrogen Vacancy (DNV) vector magnetometer installed aboard a vessel is used to highlight challenges with this approach.},

  abstract = {Raw GNSS measurement APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) in the Android system are a bridge between the advances of positioning techniques and the applications of positioning for billions of Android users in the mass market. The publication trend since the debut of these APIs in 2016 has shown an increasing attention from both academia and industry. Among all GNSS topics, high precision positioning on smartphones may be the most attractive one, not just because it spawns over 1/3 of publications, but more importantly, it may trigger a plethora of possible novel applications, such as lane-level driving, mapping, and precise augmented reality. To facilitate this process, in this paper, Google releases 60+ datasets collected from phones in the Android GPS team, together with corrections from SwiftNavigation Inc. and Verizon Inc. These datasets were collected on highways in the US San Francisco Bay Area in the summer of 2020. They will be released at g.co/gnsstools by November 2020. Ground truth files collected by a NovAtel SPAN system will also be provided in NMEA file format. Furthermore, Google also provides the source codes in Matlab to evaluate the positioning performance. This paper provides details of these datasets, corrections, ground truth files, and utilities.},

Gait event segmentation and projection are used to convert the inertial signals to image-like tabular samples, from which a Convolutional neural network (CNN) extracts geometrical features for walking direction inference. To embrace the diversity of individual walking characteristics and different ways to carry the device, tailor-made models are constructed based on individual users’ gait characteristics and the device-carrying mode. Experimental assessments of the proposed method and a competing method (RoNIN) are carried out in reallife situations and over 3 km total walking distance, covering indoor and outdoor environments, involving both sighted and visually impaired volunteers carrying the device in three different ways: texting, swinging and in a jacket pocket. PatternNet estimates the walking directions with a mean accuracy between 7 to 10 degrees for the three test persons and is 1.5 times better than RONIN estimates.},

  abstract = {Navigation and positioning systems dependent on both the operating environment and the behaviour of the host vehicle or user. The environment determines the type and quality of radio signals available for positioning and the behaviour can contribute additional information to the navigation solution. In order to operate across different contexts, a context-adaptive navigation solution is required to detect the operating contexts and adopt different positioning techniques accordingly. This paper focuses on detecting both environmental and behavioural contexts as a whole with smartphone sensors, serving for a context-adaptive navigation system. Behavioural contexts cover both human activities and different vehicle motions. The performance of behaviour recognition in this paper is improved by feature selection and a connectivity dependent filter. Environmental contexts are detected from GNSS measurements. They are classified into indoor, intermediate and outdoor categories using a probabilistic support vector machine, followed by a hidden Markov model used for time-domain filtering. As there will never be completely reliable context detection, the paper also shows how behaviours can be associated within environment detection to improve the reliability of context determination algorithms. Finally, the proposed context-determination algorithms are tested in a series of multi-context scenarios.},

However, the SCBOC should have the ability to participate in the pseudorange measurement like other BOC-class subcarriers instead of just being regarded as a transparent multiplexing tool. In addition, since the SCBOC(14,2) modulated signal has a high-frequency subcarrier, it may contain the ultra-high-performance ranging potential, which is very valuable and worthy of attention. Therefore, this paper first analyses the ranging potential and tracking challenges of the SCBOC(14,2) modulated signal, and then proposes an example solution to explore the ultra-high-precision ranging potential of the BDS-3 B1 signal. Real experimental results using live BDS-3 signals verified the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. For BDS receiver designers who are interested in the high-precision ranging, this paper can provide great guidance and reference.},

Trajectory maintenance and multitarget state extraction in the GM-PHD filter have not been effectively integrated to date. To address this problem, we propose an improved GM-PHD filter. In this approach, the Gaussian components are classified and labeled, and multitarget state extraction is converted into multiple single-state extractions. This provides the identity label of the individual target and can shield against the negative effects of clutter in the prior density region on the estimates, thus realizing the integration of trajectory maintenance with state extraction in the GM-PHD filter. As no additional associated procedures are required, the overall real-time performance of the proposed filter is similar to or slightly lower than that of the basic GM-PHD filter.

  abstract = {GNSS-based positioning system could provide accurate and real-time positioning information. It is necessary to meet the requirements of GNSS positioning performance in terms of accuracy and integrity. For automatic driving, if a large positioning error is ignored, it might result in a bad decision making and endanger the safety of both drivers and passengers; the drivers or the intelligent systems inside the smart vehicles need to make decisions on when to brake so as to avoid the collisions. So it is necessary to estimate the positioning accuracy of vehicles in real-time.Many researches have been done to estimate the positioning accuracy of GNSS in urban environments. The accuracy indicator of GNSS receivers can roughly estimate the positioning accuracy. However, the performance of the indicator can be severely degraded by the limited satellite visibility, multipath effects, and interference. The protection level (PL) mentioned in the advanced Receiver Autonomus Integrity Monitoring (ARAIM) is used to estimate the boundary of the positioning errors, but it cannot be applied directly to vehicle applications since the complex environments will make the performance of the protection level worse. This paper presents a method for positioning accuracy estimation in urban environments. We use the decision tree model in machine learning, to train a model for estimating the positioning accuracy. The main advantage of the proposed method lies in the use of multiple features that indicate the positioning accuracy.To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we consider a scenario where a cluster of vehicles drive in the urban environments. The preliminary experimental results show that the method proposed can accurately estimate the positioning accuracy and inform users in time, the probability of which is more than 95\%.},

  abstract = {Time Synchronization Attack (TSA) is a typical kind of GNSS spoofing, which can deceive receivers with fake GNSS signals. Different from other kinds of spoofing, TSA only aims at timing receivers whose positions are always unchanging and easy to acquire. So that TSA signals may be more difficult to defend as more sophisticated spoofing is realizable when attackers get the static victim position. Therefore, specialized anti-TSA methods are necessary to maintain the safety of timing receivers. And among different kinds of TSA detections, those that can be applied in a single receiver and do not require any additional facilities are widely accepted for being easy to popularize. Hence, in this paper, we come up with such a TSA detection and discrimination method by proposing a tailored Signal Quality Monitor (SQM) method, the Multi-Channel Joint SQM. This method can detect the abnormal synchronicity of distortions of different correlation peaks in different receiving loops. And this abnormal synchronicity is proved to be inevitable for TSA as long as it wants to meet the basic constraints, providing correct positions and avoiding sudden timing jumps. Thus, by jointly monitoring different correlation peaks, the proposed method can greatly improve the detection performance against TSA and provide further spoofing discrimination ability. Besides, as a kind of SQM, the proposed method can work as soon as the spoofing begins to seize receiving channels, thereby alerting the victim promptly. And in this paper, these aforementioned anti-TSA abilities are verified on a self-designed real-world test-bed. From experiment results in five different TSA conditions, the proposed method is believed to provide reliable detection and discrimination when the spoofing power advantage is lower than 8dB, while higher spoofing power is too conspicuous for stealthy TSA. And the proposed method can be more practical by combining it with a simple signal power meter. Moreover, further experiments show that the proposed method outperforms off-the-shelf SQM methods in TSA conditions.},

  abstract = {Generally, GNSS receiver’s measurement noise is assumed to be Gaussian distribution. However, be subject to various noise sources, the measurements from low-cost devices do not follow the Gaussian white noise assumption used in Kalman filter which often show strong characteristics of colored noise especially in challenging environment. Many of the involved noises such satellite clock error and multipath are presented as time-correlated. To deal with this problem, an approach based on colored Kalman filter (CKF) is presented in this paper, which considers measurement time-correlation by a first order autoregressive model and rebuilds a new measurement model for the CKF. A short baseline RTK experiment is performed with a low-cost receiver in challenging environment. The experiment results show that the state variance matrix obtained by the CKF can perfectly reflect the realistic position error, while the estimate of the standard Kalman filter is found too optimistic to reveal the realistic value. In addition, the CKF can improve around 30\% of the AR (Ambiguity Resolution) convergence time, and the reliability of AR has pretty high AR ratio in challenging environment.},

  abstract = {There are more systems than ever reliant on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), which results in even more systems than ever being susceptible to Radio Frequency Interference (RFI). Even RFI at low levels can be catastrophic to systems dependent on GNSS. RFI signals can prevent GNSS signals from reaching the user (interference or jamming) or provide the user false signals resulting in an incorrect position and time solution (spoofing). Our effort centers on developing a low-cost GNSS monitor utilizing the u-blox F9 GNSS receiver, an inexpensive commercial receiver offering multi-constellation and dual frequency position and time solutions, as well as many powerful RFI detection metrics. Different receivers and antennas may react differently in RFI scenarios based on both hardware and software configurations, and offer varying RFI rejection techniques and detection metrics to the user. As a result, it is important to gain a good understanding of the receiver's behavior. This begins by doing a thorough analysis of the receiver's performance under nominal conditions. Multiple u-Blox F9 receivers have been deployed with custom software to monitor and record data across the United States for extended periods of time. This paper analyzes the receiver’s baseline response in different nominal environments over thirty continuous days. Several of the receiver’s RFI detection metrics are analyzed and compared between receivers both close and hundreds of miles apart, including automatic gain control (AGC), carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N0), spectral analysis, and built in RFI indicators. Having an in depth understanding of the variance in these metrics under nominal conditions allows for much more accurate and effective RFI detection and characterization by distinguishing nominal changes from more dangerous jamming or spoofing. The analysis of these metrics over an extended period is presented within the paper and demonstrates the value of rigorous data collection/monitoring/analysis enabled through this low-cost sensor network.},

  abstract = {Automatic maneuvering of vessels requires reliable and highly accurate navigation. Therefore, this publication describes the development of a tightly coupled navigation filter used as a state estimator for automated driving for vessels operating in harbors. The filter estimates 3D-position, -velocity and -orientation, bases on inertial quantities and is aided by pseudoranges, deltaranges and carrier phases. In order to achieve high position accuracy carrier phase ambiguity is estimated within the filter states and fixed by LAMBDA. For common-mode error mitigation, differential data from a reference station network is integrated, received via cellular connection. The accuracy of the ambiguity estimate correlates with the accuracy of the height estimate. In harbors, accurate height information is available in the form of sea level. Therefore, this work integrates sea level data into the ambiguity estimation of the navigation filter, and thereby significantly improves time to fix. Frequent cellular service outages can be observed in the harbor, which results in losing high accuracy temporally, or even the ambiguity fix. To enable continuous, reliable high accuracy positioning, a new Kalman filter-based local estimation of differential data is implemented, such that a continuous stream of differential data is provided. Extensive evaluation with an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) in Rostock Harbor, Germany, is performed. Time to fix is evaluated with simple GPS L1/L2C wide-lane carrier phases, as this allows sufficient constellations with more than 4 satellites for navigation. With sea level data, a nearly instantaneous ambiguity fix is achieved (time-to-fix in average 1.5 s). Results show, that the local estimation of differential data allows ambiguity fixing, even if the last received differential epoch is older than 2.5 min, which is an important achievement for autonomous navigation. Over all, a 3D-position accuracy of less than 40 cm is achieved, even with frequently cellular connection outages of several minutes. In phases where outages of only a few seconds occur, a 3D-position accuracy of less than 10 cm is achieved. The implementation bases on GPS and can be further improved in the future by adding Galileo observables.},

  abstract = {This publication describes the further development of a high accuracy navigation filter especially designed for maritime applications. It is part of the developments of the maritime joint project GALILEOnautic 2, which develops a system for autonomous vessel maneuvering and docking in harbors. The proposed navigation filter is tightly-coupled and bases on quantities of an inertial measurement unit (IMU), is aided by a Doppler velocity log (DVL), and signals of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Particularly, the navigation filter processes GNSS observables of two systems, the Global Positioning System (GPS) and the European satellite system Galileo. Proper filter initialization is crucial for fast and reliable convergence of the filter states. This paper addresses challenges of maritime navigation filter initialization and the influence of erroneous filter state initialization, e.g. disturbed magnetometer measurements on state estimation. To achieve reliable convergence behavior after initialization, even with heavy erroneous initial state calculation, this paper introduces a new dual constellation double differencing update within a tightly-coupled unscented Kalman filter (UKF). A dual antenna approach is realized, where the UKF predicts the double differenced measurement by means of the known baseline of the two antennas. A structure with two GNSS UKF filter updates is introduced. The first update processes dual frequency corrected, dual constellation pseudo- and deltarange observables from a single antenna only. For the synchronization of the GPS and Galileo observables it utilizes the reliable but still slightly inaccurate Galileo GGTO message. The second update processes single frequency, double differenced pseudoranges from two antennas. Here, the synchronization is performed by another, more accurate new method: The double differencing chooses two reference satellites, one from the GPS- and one from the Galileo observables. This is practicable thanks to the tightly-coupled structure, which makes the filter independent from a minimum set of observables of each system. The navigation filter is evaluated in extensive test drives with a car in Campus Melaten, Aachen, with maritime filter initialization assumptions and methods. Results are compared to those of a dual constellation aided filter with a single antenna and a corresponding extended Kalman filter (EKF). A discussion investigates the influence of the dual antenna double differencing on the state estimation. All configurations are compared to an RTK reference measurement. A significantly improved orientation estimation right after initialization, which is accompanied with a more precise position estimation, is achieved.},

  abstract = {When the carrier does angular motion, the different installation position between master strapdown inertial navigation system (M-SINS) and the wing-mounted slave strapdown inertial navigation system (S-SINS) will lead to lever arm effect, which seriously affects the accuracy of transfer alignment of S-SINS. In practical flight, wing’s elastic deformation will change the length of lever arm and lead to dynamic lever arm effect. This paper presents a real-time dynamic lever arm estimation method. The proposed method estimates the length of the dynamic lever arm in real time by adding the length into state variables of transfer alignment. Firstly, the relationships of the length of lever arm with leverarm velocity error and lever-arm acceleration error are established, and both of them are added into the error equations of S-SINS system as parameters to establish the complete error equations of S-SINS system with lever arm effect error. Then, the filter model of S-SINS system is designed. On the one hand, the state matrix is derived according to the error equations of S-SINS, which contains the length of lever arm as state variable. On the other hand, the measurement equation is inferred from the relation between the output of M-SINS and S-SINS with velocity plus angular velocity matching method. Finally, the length of dynamic lever arm is estimated by unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) as one of state variables. The estimated length of dynamic lever arm can be used to calculate lever-arm velocity error and lever-arm acceleration error. To validate the proposed method, a simulation experiment is conducted in MATLAB. The simulation experiment uses second-order Markov process to simulate the elastic deformation of wing. The simulation results indicate that the proposed method is able to estimate the change of the dynamic lever arm caused by the elastic deformation of wing in real-time, and achieves the high accuracy estimation of misalignment angle after compensating the lever arm effect error.},

Most UWB positioning systems assume prior knowledge on the positions of the UWB anchors. Without knowing the UWB anchor positions, an accurate position estimate of an UWB tag is difficult. Hence, this paper presents a novel cooperative pedestrian simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm using an UWB positioning system without the necessity to have the prior information on the UWB anchor positions. To obtain accurate estimates of the UWB anchor positions, the estimations of the UWB anchor positions are shared between different mobile units. An increased accuracy of the estimated UWB anchor position relates directly to a more accurate position estimate of the mobile unit position. We evaluate the proposed algorithm based on measurements with multiple mobile units and fixed anchors with unknown positions. The evaluations show that an accurate position estimation of both the mobile units and the anchors is possible without any prior knowledge on the UWB anchor positions.},

  author = {Gentner, Christian and Pöhlmann, Robert and Jost, Thomas and Dammann, Armin},
  abstract = {This paper presents and extends the idea of multipath assisted positioning, named Channel-SLAM. Generally, multipath reception degrades the accuracy of the positioning device as long as the receiver is based on standard methods. Strategies to mitigate multipath effects on range estimates are in general based on the estimation of the channel impulse response (CIR). All these methods have in common that they determine the CIR in order to remove the influence on the estimate of the line-of-sight (LoS) path delay. In contrast, Channel-SLAM uses the multipath propagation of the wireless signal to allow positioning in cases of insufficient number of transmitters or increase the accuracy otherwise. Channel-SLAM treats multipath components (MPCs) as signals from virtual transmitters (VTs) which are time synchronized to the physical transmitter and fixed in their position. To use the information of the MPCs, Channel-SLAM estimates the user position and the position of the VTs simultaneously and does not require any prior information such as room-layout or a database for fingerprinting. For Channel-SLAM it is essential to get angle of arrival (AoA) information for each MPC in order to estimate the VT position. However, obtaining AoA information in mobile receivers like smartphones is difficult in most of the cases. Hence, this paper estimates the AoA during the receiver movement using only a single receive antenna by a phase difference calculation, i.e. the Doppler-Shift, of the complex amplitude of a MPC at consecutive time steps. To improve further the accuracy of Channel-SLAM, additionally an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is fused to obtain heading information of the moving receiver. The derived algorithm is evaluated based on measurements where only one physical transmitter was used.},

WiFi-RTT enables ranging measurements between a device, i.e. a smartphone, and fixed WiFi-RTT access points (WiFi-RTT-APs). Because the location of WiFi-RTT-APs are typically unknown, this paper presents a novel algorithm which estimates the position of a smartphone together with the location of the WiFi-RTT-APs using a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) method.

We show, that the smartphone and the WiFi-RTT-APs can be localized within meter accuracy, having no prior knowledge about the environment.},

GNSS receivers alone cannot be used for control and guidance applications in environments with degraded or denied satellite signals. The common solution to solve the problems in GNSS-only navigation is to integrate GNSS with inertial sensors. In order to assure the required levels of accuracy for control and guidance applications, higher end inertial sensors are used for applications that can afford them. Micro-electromechanical-systems (MEMS)-based inertial sensors are low-cost, light weight, compact, and have low power consumption; all these features give them advantages to be used in navigation systems. The drawback of MEMSbased inertial sensors is their complex error characteristics, including high drift rates, bias instabilities, and high noise levels. Appropriate and robust inertial sensor error modeling is mandatory in order to use these sensors for accurate navigation.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the typically ignored topic domain of unintentional GNSS RFI, as opposed to the more commonly documented maliciously generated RFI events, including jamming and spoofing. We begin by defining the numerous sources of unintentional RFI that have been encountered directly by the authors as well as those located through literature survey, then proceed to document examples of observations of the various families and source types of the unintentional RFI discussed. Based on the observations presented here, it is believed that unintentional RFI is presently a larger threat to L1/E1 band device operation than to the other GNSS frequency bands, but that trends in GNSS equipment itself may lead to the other GNSS frequency bands experiencing rapid increases in incidence rates of unintentional RFI over the coming decade.},

Classification and analysis of GNSS RFI data from a period of 20 months is presented, where a simple correlation analysis is performed to understand RFI effects on some GNSS parameters. It is shown that the main type of GNSS RFI severely affecting GNSS receivers are jammers, yet jammers are in no way the most prevalent cause for RFI observed. The data presented shows a continuation of trends described in earlier monitoring campaigns, with a slight increase of jammers in 2021.},

These digital samples can be processed in postmission using a GNSS receiver, allowing evaluation of different signal acquisition and tracking strategies. In practice, however, the data storage and management associated with such large IF data sets are prohibitive and more typically, only post-correlator in-phase (I) and quadraphase (Q) samples at a lower data rate are provided by commercial units in the field. To exploit these low frequency data sets from commercial receivers for postprocessing in a software receiver, some manipulation of the observations is required. In this study, we have introduced a method to exploit raw data from scintillation monitors for studies of GNSS receiver design and, using the subsequent simulated IF samples, we have conducted initial studies to determine optimum settings and strategies to mitigate scintillation impact on multifrequency receiver performance.},

Simulated signals are processed using a software receiver and impact on observation quality is quantified in terms of loss-of-lock probability and tracking errors; number of satellites affected simultaneously is also determined. A generic carrier tracking loop is implemented to determine impact on lowcost single frequency (marine and aviation) receiver performance.

  abstract = {This paper describes a location algorithm for mobile phones based on image recognition. The use of image recognition based (IRB) positioning in mobile applications is characterized by the availability of a single camera; under this constraint, to estimate the camera position and orientation, a prior knowledge of 3D environment is needed in the form of a database of images with associated spatial information; this database can be built projecting the 3D model, acquired for instance with a LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging), on a set of synthetic images. The herein proposed procedure to locate the camera can be divided in two steps, a first step is the selection from a database of the most similar image to the query image used to locate the camera, and a second step for estimation of the position and orientation of the camera based on available 3D information on the reference image. In designing the proposed location procedure, we have reused as much as possible the MPEG standard Compact Descriptors for Visual Search. For processing load optimization, similarly to the retrieval procedure defined by MPEG, we have introduced also in the position estimation step a preliminary statistical geometric check for coarse rejection of wrong matches (where a match represents two views in the respective images of the same point). We present the position and orientation accuracy results of the location methodology, for indoor and outdoor environment, that reaches respectively few decimeters and tenth of radians of precision.},

  abstract = {Currently, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is a key element of the navigation system in maritime applications, it is the main source of Position Velocity and Time (PVT) information. The recent development of new GNSS constellations and the emerging threats pushed for urgent update of the maritime standards. In order to assess the readiness of maritime GNSS devices, the European GNSS Agency (GSA) launched a call for expression of interest to test Galileo-enabled ship-borne receivers at the end of 2018. The campaign was completed in second half of 2019 in the GNSS testing facilities of the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the European Commission’s in-house science service. The aim of this test campaign was twofold: firstly to assess the correctness of the implementation of Galileo, and secondly, to identify potential performance improvements and non-compliances to the requirements set for Galileo in the International Electrotechnical Committee (IEC) Maritime Standard IEC 61108-3:2010. The paper presents the maritime GNSS receivers test campaign: seven receivers were tested in twenty four test cases covering PVT accuracy, sensitivity, robustness against interference, RAIM/FDE and NMEA support. From the tests, it emerges that all the devices under test (DUTs) exhibit very good performance in terms of position, speed and heading accuracy, and re-acquisition capabilities. In addition, for all the DUTs the performance under interferences is remarkable since the position accuracy performance is always well below the threshold set in the standard. In particular, it emerges that mitigation technique is internally developed and particularly effective. From the analyses it emerges also that the DUTs exhibits proper behavior in terms of RAIM/FDE, but it must be pointed out that the information extracted from GSA and GBS messages are sometime not consistent with what observed in position domain.},

  abstract = {The development of techniques and algorithms for merging measurements from different collaborative GNSS devices is an open challenge. The typical user of smart-phone moves around the city, in this scenario GNSS signals can be blocked or affected by multipath. In these circumstances, the navigation solution may experience severe degradation. If a measurement is affected by a gross error, it can be identified and excluded. In urban navigation, the presence of multiple outliers is common and the exclusion of several measurements affected by errors can cause a significant reduction of the satellite geometry. A possible solution is the identification of the blunders and the replacement of such measurements with observables provided by a nearby device. This replacement can compensate for the geometry degradation due to the rejection of multiple satellite signals. In this paper, three methods to merge measurements obtained from two nearby smart-phones are presented. The proposed methods allow the joint use of measurements collected by mobile devices operating in an independent mode and thus not connected to the same external clock. In order to jointly use measurements from different devices, the differences between the clocks of the devices have to be taken into account. Hence, their parameters need to be included in the estimation process. The three approaches proposed are: Direct Measurement Sharing (DMS), Augmented Measurement Sharing (AMS) and Correct Measurement Sharing (CMS). In the first one, cooperating devices share raw pseudorange and Doppler shift measurements; in this case, measurements from one satellite are scarified to estimate the additional unknowns related to the parameter of the clock of the aiding device. In the AMS, the cooperating devices share the measurements as well as the estimates of the clock parameters and their accuracy. In this case, the parameters of the clock of the aiding device can be directly observed introducing additional equations (containing the shared clock bias and drift) into the measurement model. In the CMS case, the cooperating devices share pseudoranges and Doppler shifts corrected for the clock bias and clock drift, respectively. With this approach, the clock parameters of the aiding device do not need to be estimated. The methods have been validated using static and kinematic real data: tests were performed using devices from three manufacturers with different versions of operating system. From the tests, the effectiveness of the proposed methods was demonstrated and the benefits of the combined solutions with respect to the single device solutions were shown.},

  abstract = {Several layers of defense can be implemented in a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver to improve its performance in the presence of interference. These layers include the use of pre-correlation mitigation techniques, post-correlation quality indicators to screen measurements and Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) at the position solution level. This paper provides a characterization of the interaction between these layers of interference mitigation and measurement quality check. Data collected in the presence of increasing power jamming levels have been processed using different interference mitigation techniques, including Robust Interference Mitigation (RIM) and the Adaptive Notch Filter (ANF). A Software Defined Radio (SDR) approach has been adopted and measurements were generated considering five interference mitigation techniques. Position solutions were then computed using the Forward-Backward approach for Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM). Signals from GPS, Galileo and Beidou were processed and both single and dual constellation solutions were analysed. The analysis shows that interference mitigation allows the receiver to track a higher number of signals, even in the presence of high jamming levels. This increased measurement availability is then effectively exploited by RAIM techniques that provide reliable solutions. Measurements from several constellation further improve the reliable availability of the position solutions.},

  abstract = {As the world continues towards autonomy, the need for continuous, precise, and robust navigation is becoming increasingly important. A new wave of modernized Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals are currently being implemented on the latest satellite blocks. The focus of this work is on the Global Positioning System (GPS) L5 signal, and while it is not yet fully available there are now windows of time where experimental data can be used to test modified algorithms exploiting the nature of the new signal structures. The GPS L5 signal is a Quadrature Phase-Shift keying (QPSK) signal that has both an in-phase (data) and quadrature (pilot) arm in the signal that are transmitted together. The pilot channel is not modulated with a data message which historically limits the length of coherent integration during tracking. This work adapts a vector tracking algorithm, which has been shown in prior works to provide a more robust navigation solution than scalar tracking architectures, to the GPS L5 signal structure. The traditional vector tracking architecture for both GPS L1 and L5 quadrature independently are compared to adapted methods. For the first method, the L5 in-phase and L5 quadrature discriminator measurements are combined before being added to the Kalman filter to update the Position, Velocity, and Timing (PVT) solution and Numerically Controlled Oscillators (NCOs). For the second method, L5 in-phase and L5 quadrature are tracked independently and both provide measurements to the same filter for PVT and NCO updates. This second method removes the limit on integration lengths for the L5 quadrature channel allowing for varying extended integration lengths on this channel. All methods are post processed on live sky data from only Block IIF and III satellites and simulated data from a Spirent GNSS simulator and evaluated. A covariance analysis is also performed comparing the methods. Lastly an ionospheric free vector tracking measurement is developed and applied to a GPS L1 GPS L5 dual frequency vector tracking receiver. This receivers results are compared against a single frequency receiver with an ionospheric model for corrections. The GPS L5 receiver with extended integration periods provided an improvement to the stability of the receiver in degraded environments and provided better filtering of measurements and states. The GPS L5 combined receiver was able to increase the tracking threshold of the receiver by 1-3 dB-Hz over receivers with equivalent integration periods. The ionospheric free combination receiver was able to provide equivalent results to the ionospheric model in simulation, but the live sky results were not as stable as the simulated results. The linear combination of the two vector tracking measurements greatly increases the variance of the measurements.},

  abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite Systems receivers use pseudorange measurements for positioning and time determination. The control system uses the same measurements for estimating the satellite orbits, clock offsets and signal biases in a complex estimation process, which additionally involves the determination of atmospheric delays. In current systems, the separation of these different parameters imposes strong requirements on the stability of the satellite clocks and on the ground infrastructure. Several hundred ground monitoring stations are additionally used in high accuracy applications. The Kepler proposal follows a different approach. It re-uses the Galileo constellation of Medium Earth Orbiting (MEO) satellites, as well as its signals but complements them by a small constellation of Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites and by selected optical Inter-Satellite Links (ISL). The LEO satellites are used to observe the signals transmitted by the MEO satellites from outside the atmosphere. The optical ISL connect all satellites in a multi-hop fashion. This enables a direct synchronization of the satellites at a level not achievable today and additionally does not require that the MEO satellites are equipped with clocks. The optical ISL furthermore provide ranges rather than pseudoranges for orbit determination as well as a broadband intra-system communication network. Terrestrial infrastructures become mostly obsolete with the Kepler approach. A single monitoring and control station remains necessary to maintain the alignment with earth-rotation, the synchronization to Universal Time Coordinate (UTC), and the capability of controlling the system.},

The growing availability of mass market products is also driving innovation towards automation in several civil and scientific areas. Specific applications such as precision farming, surveying, rescue operations and remote exploration can benefit from such modern and affordable robots, thus helping humans in work-related or daily life. To support such a new generation of service robots and vehicles, navigation capabilities play a fundamental role in mission planning and on-field activities. In parallel, recent developments of ultra-low cost embedded Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), such as in Android™ smartphones has enabled affordable Location Based Services (LBS) applications and provided an impetus to research into low cost navigation solutions. Modern smartphones come with an advantage of having a ubiquitous network infrastructure with ease of developing interconnected applications and integrated proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors. Within the framework of precision agriculture promoted by the Politecnico di Torino Interdepartmental Centre for Service Robotics, this work investigates a low-cost navigation strategy for an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) – Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) paradigm exploiting a collaborative ranging technique based on Differential GNSS (DGNSS) approach applied on raw measurements exchanged between Android™ smartphones.},

  author = {Golshan, Robert and Fan, Tiange and Arredondo, Alberto},
  abstract = {This paper addresses the impact of C/A-on-C/A interference on carrier tracking loop of a GPS receiver. A postcorrelator model is derived by analyzing the signal, interference and noise components at the output of the prompt correlator. Using computer simulations, C/A-onC/A interference is further characterized at the correlator output, and its impact on carrier tracking phase error is examined. To date, there are different perspectives on how C/A-on-C/A interference should be viewed. One viewpoint models the interference waveform as a nonwhite random process whose impact on receiver performance can be assessed through evaluations of the signalto-noise ratio (SNR) at the output of the correlator [12]. This approach introduces the concept of effective noise which refers to the additional amount of white noise that has to be introduced at the receiver’s input in order to yield the same effective SNR at the output of the correlator. It is then implied that this effective noise has the same impact on receiver performance as does the (nonwhite) C/A-on-C/A interference. Another viewpoint argues that the effects of C/A-on-C/A interference should not be modeled as noise enhancement but rather as signal distortion, much like in a multi-path scenario [15]. The objective of this paper is to examine the C/A-on-C/A interference problem in order to solidify conclusions regarding its impact on carrier tracking.},

  abstract = {In this work several machine-learning (ML) techniques for predicting ionospheric irregularities in the northern auroral zone were tested. The techniques include Ridge Regression, Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM), Classification Neural Network (CNN), Autoencoder Classification Neural Network (ACNN), and LSTM Autoencoder Classification Neural Network (LACNN). These techniques were tested with the rate of total electron content (TEC) index (ROTI) data collected during 2008 and 2009 from a geodetic station in Fairbanks, Alaska (64.98°N, 147.50°W), which is located in the northern auroral zone. Using ROTI data with the ML techniques, experiments were conducted to reach two goals: (1) examine what space weather measurements present good correlation with ROTI so that they may be helpful in ML-based prediction of ionospheric irregularities in the polar region; (2) predict ROTI hours and days ahead by training the neural network models with historical ROTI data alone. The Ridge Regression experiments indicate that a combination of measurements of local geomagnetic horizontal components, geomagnetic SYM-H index, 3-hour Kp and ap indices, and F10.7 solar flux index appears to be more correlated to the single-site ROTI measurements than other parameters analyzed. The neural network (NN) experiments show that although the LACNN model allows for predictions of non-irregularity and irregularity conditions defined by ROTI levels up to 3 hours in advance, with an overall accuracy ≥ 92\%, a number of irregularity events can still be missed in the predictions. Hence, further development is needed to reduce the number of missed events. In this paper, the models, data processing, model performance, prediction results, and potential applications are presented.},

It allows moving to the software side components of the receiver that traditionally have been implemented in the bare silicon. Furthermore, the flexibility of SDR technology jointly with the independence of nowadays stock-limited ASICs was validated as a feasible solution for a non-conventional and highly demanded GNSS navigation scenario. The non-conventional navigation scenario proposed is the flight of a rotation-stabilized sounding rocket.},

The use of a Redundant Inertial Measurement Unit (RIMU) configuration allows combining inertial observations not only to obtain a better performances for attitude estimation, but also to be able to detect and isolate a sensor not properly working. The output signals of uncorrelated IMU sensors can be integrated using a data fusion algorithm (e.g Extended Kalman Filter, EKF). The aim of this study is to present the implementation of several filters for an array of consumer grade IMUs placed on a "skew-redundant" configuration in a sounding rocket vehicle. The filtering method allows designing an attitude estimator capable of improving the kinematic predictions from gyroscope measurement integration by applying a correction method from accelerometer and magnetometer data. Moreover, simulations are performed to analyze the resilience and fault detection, while laboratory tests check the performance of the two proposed architectures. With the aim of testing accuracy of the algorithms for the RIMU a software simulation tool and laboratory tests are presented.},

  abstract = {To achieve an accurate and robust localization result under Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) denied environment, coupling GNSS with other sensors tends to be a promising solution, also known as the sensor fusion system. One of the most challenging scenarios in sensor fusion is to couple vision navigation system with GNSS, especially the tightly-coupled fusion. Compared with those loosely coupled ones, it performs the information fusion on a more intrinsic level, which can benefit the accuracy and robustness of the system. However, the major barrier lying in front of tightly coupling method is the way to unify the heterogeneous and asynchronous GNSS observations with vision observations. To solve this problem, we start from the Vison Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (V-SLAM) method, which has already become the mainstream in vision navigation domain. By utilizing existing attempts on graph-optimization-based GNSS data processing, we propose a joint graph optimization combining vision-SLAM with GNSS pseudorange. It is a tightly coupled fusion of GNSS and stereo camera, implemented by considering GNSS satellites as vision feature points. Based on the framework of mature state-of-art pose-graph SLAM, a graph optimization is applied simultaneously on GNSS and vision positioning, to achieve a robust, accurate, yet versatile fusion system.},

  abstract = {Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) services based on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) have a number of known drawbacks that makes them prone to suffer a disruption. These flaws can be exploited to disable this service in critical infrastructures. Therefore, the hybridization of GNSS and 5G measurements enabling Assured PNT (APNT) services is growing up and gaining attention by governmental bodies. 5G signals emitted by terrestrial networks and by Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites can complement GNSS, enhancing their reliability, security and accuracy. For example, the larger Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of a terrestrial system makes them more difficult to suffer a jamming attack as compared to GNSS signals. A joint data and positioning signal enhances the security and reliability of the APNT solution with, for example, the successful decoding of encrypted data, this could be used for system authentication. Moreover, a larger signal bandwidth increases the accuracy of the PNT solution. All of these benefits can be extracted from the 5G terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks that transmit the Positioning Reference Signal (PRS). The rationale for these benefits rely on the flexibility of this pilot signal in terms of bandwidth or symbols used for the APNT service. This paper aims to analyse how this flexibility can be optimized to achieve a specific level of accuracy, minimizing the resources used under certain constrains of bandwidth or latency.},

  abstract = {All the current GNSS constellations comprise L-Band satellites orbiting the Earth within different types of orbits. Although the widely used approach for decades comprised Medium Earth Orbits (MEO), - as it was the case for GPS, Galileo and GLONASS - QZSS, NavIC and BeiDou added Inclined Geosynchronous (IGSO) \& Geostationary (GEO) Orbits satellites, with the aim of improving satellite visibility over certain areas. On the other hand, one of the main commercial GNSS-related applications over the past years has been high accuracy positioning, both differential (RTK) and absolute (PPP). As widely known, the main traditional drawback of PPP (Precise Point Positioning) versus RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) as a precise positioning solution, is the convergence time. Whereas RTK convergence is practically instantaneous, standard PPP processing (relying solely on orbit and clock information) requires between 30 to 40 minutes to achieve a fully converged solution. In order to bridge the aforementioned convergence gap, techniques such as PPP ambiguity fixing (by providing code and phase biases in addition to orbit and clocks) and multi-constellation processing have been used, reducing the PPP convergence time down to 10 minutes. Further techniques such as PPP-RTK have managed to reduce the convergence time close to the pure RTK solution, but with the cost of needing to provide precise atmospheric corrections to the end user. The aforementioned cost is paid in terms of required bandwidth, and reference network density, which needs to be largely increased within the area of interest, partially losing the advantage against RTK in terms of required ground infrastructure. Few years ago, the concept of bringing Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites within the GNSS satellites’ portfolio, was introduced. The MEO, IGSO and GEO satellites are far away to the Earth, and therefore their dynamics evolve in relatively slow motion. This implies that a relatively long time (minutes) is needed for achieved centimeter level accuracy (due to the time required for solving the carrier-phase ambiguity values).

  abstract = {The moving average (MA) filter is a smoothing filter well-known in the digital signal processing community. The MA filter has only one configuration parameter, N , which is the order of the filter and is used to adjust the smoothing effect of an MA filter. The MA filtering technique can be effectively used to denoise signals coming from inertial sensors. One of the drawbacks of the MA filter is that the theory behind digital signal processing does not provide a formal method to determine the value of N . Thus, N is usually chosen based on the previous experience of the MA filter designer. The present work proposes a novel approach to find the optimal value of N . The methodology compares two signals, one coming from a low-cost, MA-filtered inertial sensor, and another coming from a high-end inertial sensor. A statistical significance analysis is done for several orders of an MA filter for a particular low-cost inertial sensor. Finally, N is chosen considering the lowest MA filter order that performs the highest level of de-noising with respect to the high-end inertial sensor. The adjustment methodology is tested on four MEMS IMUs using a real-world trajectory generated by driving a vehicle. As a result, inertial sensors under study experience a noise reduction up to 52\% for noisier inertial sensors.},

By combining the multipath detection results from different multipath detectors in the time and space domain, the method is able to compensate weaknesses of single-domain multipath detection methods in adverse conditions. In the time-domain, different features of the crosscorrelation function (CCF) are analyzed and intra-domain fusion is achieved by a classification approach. In the space-domain, several signal-number criteria are evaluated and intra-domain fusion is conducted using an evidence approach. The interdomain fusion between time-domain and space-domain features is conducted by joining the detection results from the different domains to either maximize the detection rate or minimize the false alarm rate. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional single-domain single-feature detection methods in simulated conditions.},

  abstract = {Recognizing the pose of a satellite is an essential priority in docking missions and future space debris cleanup. In this work, we present a distributed framework for determining the pose estimate of a rigid object with a known 3D model through calibrated 2D images and consensus among multiple sensing agents. The introduced approach utilizes global image statistics without the need for local image features, while also leveraging a weighted consensus scheme to drive estimation in a robust fashion. By constructing an objective function that fuses segmentation energy and consensus cost, the approach can achieve marked improvement upon single-agent systems, which are shown to be prone to local minima. The method introduced is demonstrably resilient for space-based pose estimation where information transfer is hamstrung by signal interference and lowpower computing. To rigorously evaluate our proposed method, we simulated a satellite inspection scenario where images cannot be transmitted between agents in real time and operate under the assumption of having limited bandwidth. Furthermore, image quality is subject to multiple sources of degradation to reproduce obstacles native to the space domain that alternative methods struggle with. The resulting pose estimation and consensus are not only competitive with alternative approaches but also offer a novel and pragmatic framework for future multi-agent spacebased imaging problems.},

The standard measurement uncertainty of the orientation is between 1 degree to 3 degrees, dependent on the measuring time and the conditions.

GPS information is excluded from this sensor set because it is intended to use the developed estimator for GPS and Instrumental Landing System fault detection. The characteristic size of the runway is assumed to be unknown and it is estimated run-time after verifying global observability of the nonlinear system. The delay caused by image processing is dealt with a delayed-Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF). This algorithm considers dynamic propagation of the image information between acquisition and application forward in time thus the delay does not appear in the system dynamics. The first evaluation of the estimator is done for ideal simulated data to verify applicability of the delayed-ESKF and its flawless implementation. Then more realistic simulated data with sensor biases and noise is considered to verify closer to realistic performance and bias estimation precision. Finally, the estimator is tested with real flight data collected in the VISION EU H2020 research project. Estimation results are compared to GPS SBAS-based data and Airbus precision tolerances showing satisfactory performance. The methodological contribution of the paper is the unique combination of existing methods and ideas leading to a new solution proven to work satisfactorily even with real flight data.},

In addition, the UAV shares inertial measurement unit and laser altimeter data to the UGV over a local WiFi network.

A simulation environment is developed and used to evaluate dynamic baseline estimation performance under various conditions including: varying multipath intensity, occurence of phase breaks, IR-UWB measurement noise and time-lag with respect to GPS. The incorporation of IR-UWB ranging is shown to offer improved 3-D relative positioning accuracy and robustness when faced with these common errors. Two formulations are presented and compared with and without the IR-UWB ranging source, including fixing integer phase biases with the Least-squares AMBiguity Decorrelation Adjustment (LAMBDA) method, and a differential method that does not require bias fixing and instead time differences two single-difference observations to eliminate phase ambiguities. In addition, trade-offs of integrating the IR-UWB with respect to measurement rate, communication throughput, and maximum distance are also presented. Potential applications of this technology are those that require accurate and robust relative navigation, including: cooperative remote sensing, distributed synthetic aperture radar, aircraft formation flight for fuel saving, collision avoidance, and aircraft traffic management, as well as extensions to ground (e.g. driverless cars) applications.},

  abstract = {Conventional GNSS positioning in dense urban areas exhibits errors of tens of meters due to non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reception and multipath interference. Inertially-aided extended coherent integration within the GNSS receiver, as in the case of supercorrelation or S-GPS/GNSS, mitigates these effects by making the receiver more sensitive to directly received signals than reflected signals whenever the receiver is moving. This reduces multipath interference and makes NLOS signals easier to detect using signal-to-noise measurements. 3D-mapping-aided (3DMA) GNSS uses predictions of which signals are NLOS to enhance the positioning algorithms. 3DMA GNSS ranging algorithms can be combined with shadow matching, which uses the signal-tonoise measurements. Both supercorrelation and 3DMA GNSS can improve positioning accuracy in dense urban areas by more than a factor of two.

To improve the accuracy of ranging, we propose in this paper to replace the currently used Minimum Shift Keying (MSK) modulation with Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK). By applying a Gaussian pulse shape for the bit transition to that of the MSK a higher spectral efficiency is achieved. If the data rate is kept constant, this reduces the energy of the modulated signal within the bandwidth of the phase estimator. This increases the accuracy of the added carrier estimate and achieves our goal of improved distance-estimation accuracy. In this paper, we compare the estimates for an R-Mode signal with MSK and two different GMSK modulations. The increased accuracy is verified using software and hardware in-the-loop simulations.},

Furthermore, most Precise Point Positioning (PPP) algorithms use ambiguity estimation techniques in order to leverage the precision of carrier phase measurements. We developed a low-cost PPP algorithm fused with an Inertial Measurement Unit that uses Time Differenced Carrier Phase (TDCP) measurements which remove the need to resolve the ambiguities while still benefiting from the most accurate Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observables. To maximize the accuracy and continuity of the positioning solution, we designed a tightly coupled Extended Kalman Filter that is capable of processing triple frequency code, Doppler, and carrier phase or TDCP measurements. We observed that the filter which uses TDCP measurements performs 52\% better than the solution with solely the code and Doppler measurements in deep urban conditions and 5\% in open-sky conditions while taking 66\% less computation time (in MATLAB) than the filter with carrier phase measurements. The results demonstrate that TDCP measurements are a solid alternative to carrier phase measurements, especially in deep urban conditions, for any computationally limited applications while maintaining a high level of accuracy.},

We have shown that PPP, in conjunction with techniques developed for integrity in aviation, can be used to produce meter-level protection levels for static, automotive, and flight scenarios [3]. Solution separation, which requires the creation of solutions that are tolerant to faults or sets of faults, has been shown to provide integrity to the PPP algorithm [3]. This paper builds off of previous work to improve a PPP with solution separation algorithm by using an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to improve solution and protection level continuity. Grouping of fault modes, in conjunction with the IMU and PPP, is shown to reduce computational load while maintaining high levels of performance. Finally, this paper introduces a method to reduce the fault exposure time for sequential filters with solution separation.},

  abstract = {Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) can provide time, location, speed information at anytime and anywhere. Moreover, it can realize navigation, high-precision positioning, and time service in real time. Because satellite navigation signals are susceptible to various types of intentional or unintentional interference, which has great influence on navigation application security, it is urgent to develop GNSS interference monitoring system to provide decision basis for responding to interference. Interference signal modulation recognition in GNSS is helpful to identify users and distinguish sources of interference, and increase situational awareness. In order to improve the recognition accuracy in the case of low interference-signal power rate (ISR), a new recognition method based on fusion time-frequency features and convolutional neural network is proposed. The new time-frequency transform combining short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and WignerVille distribution (WVD) was proposed aiming at the problem of mutual restriction between time-frequency focusing and cross term suppression of single time-frequency transform. The new fusion time-frequency features combine the characteristics of STFT without cross term and WVD with high time-frequency resolution. Taking time-frequency image as recognition feature provides a new method for GNSS interference signal recognition. By learning the time-frequency characteristics of interference signal, the modulation recognition problem is transformed into image recognition problem. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in the field of computer vision, it shows excellent performance in image classification and image recognition. This article uses convolutional neural network to complete the classification of interference signals. Through pre-process, fusion time-frequency features are converted into dimensions suitable for CNN training and learning, and then use the CNN classifier in this paper to complete modulation recognition. The experimental results show that the new combined time-frequency transform features can realize the classification and identification of typical modulated interference signals, and compared with the single timefrequency transform, the recognition accuracy of interference modulation is improved, and the recognition effect is better.},

  abstract = {Space non-cooperative targets are often in the state of tumbling. It doesn’t communicate in information and doesn’t cooperate in maneuvering. The difficulty of tumbling spacecraft capture is how to accurately obtain the relative position and attitude information of the target when the target's motion and spatial structure are unknown. Tumbling spacecraft capture is often divided into the following four stages: (1) flying-around; (2) hovering; (3) approach; (4) close-range capture. In this paper, the dynamics modeling, motion state estimation, and capture path planning of a tumbling spacecraft are investigated. Dynamic environmental map updates are then performed, including information on target spacecraft, debris barriers, etc. Since the structures of tumbling spacecraft are typically easy to identify, including the solar wing and its support frame, communication antenna backplane, stararrow docking ring, and engine nozzle, here we choose the star-arrow docking ring as the capture point. During the hover phase, we propose an adaptive threshold Canny algorithm for tumbling spacecraft profile and star-arrow docking ring detection to achieve accurate identification and body point extraction of tumbling spacecraft and star-arrow docking ring. Specifically, instead of Gaussian filtering, a bilateral filter that considers both the value and spatial domains is used to combine pixel position and brightness information. The effect of the edge information is effectively protected. At the same time, the optimal threshold segmentation method is combined with the Otsu method to segment the gradient image, and the high and low thresholds of the image are calculated separately to obtain a well-effective edge feature point set for accurate identification of tumbling spacecraft. After acquiring the feature set of the tumbling spacecraft, the RANSAC algorithm is used to perform initial point cloud alignment, complete the construction of the tumbling spacecraft and its surrounding environment, and acquire the initial position attitude of the tumbling spacecraft, then the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm is used to enter the point cloud alignment to achieve accurate estimation of the position attitude of the tumbling spacecraft. On this basis, the dynamic closest point of the tumbling spacecraft is calculated based on the tumbling spacecraft motion model and the capture based on the dynamic closest point is performed. Simulation show that the proposed adaptive threshold Canny algorithm can more accurately identify the target spacecraft and the docking ring, and the improved point cloud alignment algorithm can accurately estimate the position attitude of the tumbling spacecraft, while verifying the effectiveness of the dynamic closest point-based tumbling spacecraft capture algorithm.},

  abstract = {The distance of deep space exploration is far away from earth, the communication delay is not conducive to the handling of emergencies and detector failures, and the survival of spacecraft faces a huge risk. Therefore, in the deep space, the spacecraft must rely on its own sensors to achieve positioning and environmental perception. The key problem of autonomous navigation in deep space is the nonlinear state estimation of the spacecraft in a dynamic 3D environment. However, the use of a single sensor in deep space usually has a big error, and to overcome this limitation, the state can be corrected using observations of multiple known objects in the world. This is referred to as multi-sensor fusion, since the information of multiple sensors needs to be combined in order to obtain an estimation of the state. In this paper, we combine the observations of stars in the deep space with the dynamics of celestial objects to analyze the state of spacecraft. We proposed a multi-sensor fusion method based on the square root cubature kalman filter (SRCKF) to solve the multi-sensor fusion problem of spacecraft. Specifically, we perform the improved cubature kalman filter on sensor data obtained from interferometer, star tracker, planet sensor, sun sensor, and earth sensor. In order to solve the problem of high computational complexity when SRCKF is used in nonlinear filtering problems, the QR decomposition is used to pass the covariance array square root factor, which reduces the amount of computation, avoids negative matrix determination, and improves the filtering accuracy. Then we incorporate the idea of extended information filter, according to the nature of statistical linear error propagation, the update process of the cubature kalman filter is embedded into the extended information filter framework. Specifically, the information contribution vector and information contribution matrix are proposed as the evaluation of each sensor's contribution in the filter estimation composition. And the square root of the covariance in the SRCKF process is implemented by updating the square root of the information contribution matrix. The results show that the proposed multi-sensor fusion algorithm outperforms the SRCKF and EKF algorithms in terms of position and velocity estimation.},

  abstract = {GNSS / INS integrated navigation is widely used in dynamic navigation and positioning. However, in the case of GNSS signal failure for a long time, the accuracy of GNSS / INS integrated navigation system will drop sharply due to the error accumulation of inertial components over time, and the anti-jamming ability and reliability can’t be guaranteed. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a navigation algorithm with self-learning function, which combines data denoising and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network in the traditional GNSS / INS integrated navigation. The general process of the algorithm is that when the GNSS signal is available, the velocity, yaw of INS and preprocessed IMU output are used as the input of LSTM model, the output is the position increment of GNSS. When GNSS signal is lost, the preprocessed IMU data and INS information are input into LSTM model to generate pseudo GNSS position and send it to extended Kalman filter (EKF) to correct INS navigation results. In order to obtain reliable and accurate positioning information during GPS outages, this paper proposes a data pre-processing method combining empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and wavelet threshold filtering (WTF) to process the original IMU raw measurement. First, the EMD adaptively decomposes the noisy IMU signal into a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) according to amplitude and frequency. Then, the wavelet threshold filtering is applied to high-frequency IMFs, which separates the useful information in the high-frequency IMFs. Wavelet threshold filtering using heuristic threshold and soft threshold function. Finally, these IMFs are added with IMFs of low frequency and residual signal to achieve de-noising signal. The experimental results show that the proposed navigation algorithm can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of GNSS / INS integrated navigation during GNSS outages.},

Considering the character of the high power amplifier (HPA), the envelope of multiplexed signal must be constant.

  abstract = {Emerging applications such as autonomous driving have greatly promoted innovations in GNSS positioning algorithms. It is highly expected that GNSS should provide instantaneously, without any latency or convergence, a better than 20 cm positioning accuracy in real time to satisfy the critical requirements by self-driving vehicles for highly strict safety standards. In this case, we developed a precise point positioning wide-lane ambiguity resolution (PPP-WAR) method with the goal of achieving 10-cm positioning accuracy in the horizontal component using only a single epoch of Galileo E1/E5a and E6 signals. Other GNSS constellations such as GPS/BeiDou/QZSS were also coupled tightly with Galileo to further improve PPP-WAR efficiency. To form inter-GNSS resolvable ambiguities, we firstly calculated station-specific inter-system phase biases (ISPBs) for two wide-lane phase observables, and then inter-system fractional-cycle biases (FCB) were computed to recover the integer nature of those wide-lane ambiguities. We used multi-GNSS data from 31 stations over 31 days to validate this method. We found that 93\% day-to-day variations of both wide-lane ISPBs stayed within  0.1 cycles. Besides, FCB estimates were also quite stable with a standard deviation of less than 0.03 cycles. With these phase bias corrections, we achieved a mean instantaneous positioning accuracy of 0.13 m, 0.11 m and 0.37 m for the east, north and up components, respectively, in case of Galileo/GPS/BeiDou/QZSS PPP-WAR solutions. More interestingly, a comparable positioning accuracy of 0.12 m, 0.10 m, 0.42 m could also be reached with only a single epoch of Galileo-only E1/E5a and E6 signals when there were more than 9 satellites. We note that Galileo E1/E5a/E6 signals outperform E1/E5a/E5b in enabling PPP-WAR to achieve a 10-centimeter positioning accuracy. We carried out a vehicle-borne test and achieved a positioning accuracy of 0.19 m, 0.21 m, 0.61 m for Galileo-only PPP-WAR, though the number of visible satellites was less than 7 during the experiment. Therefore, we can envision that the full Galileo constellation in the near future may be promising to enable a sub-decimeter-level instantaneous PPP-WAR service on a global scale to support autonomous driving.},

Many existing approaches use GNSS measurements to characterize protection levels (PLs) as probabilistic upper bounds on the position error. However, GNSS signals might be reflected or blocked in urban environments, and thus additional sensor modalities need to be considered to determine PLs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for computing PLs by matching camera image measurements to a LiDAR-based 3D map of the environment. We specify a Gaussian mixture model probability distribution of position error using deep neural network-based data-driven models and statistical outlier weighting techniques. From the probability distribution, we evaluate its intervals using numerical line-search methods to compute the PL. We experimentally validate our approach using real-world data and demonstrate that the PLs computed from our method are reliable upper bounds on the position error in urban environments.},

Our approach augments the models of the geometry matrix and the expected pseudorange measurement with data-driven components to improve the positioning performance in scenarios that deviate from the modeling assumptions. Through experiments on simulated data with diverse measurement errors, we show that our proposed approach achieves low positioning errors compared to other modelbased and neural network approaches with little training while requiring lesser memory for evaluation.},

Our filter design employs Rao-Blackwellization to decouple the state into a non-linearly tracked position and linearly tracked orientation, velocity and carrier phase integer ambiguities. This factorization allows our filter to efficiently track the state along with a rich probability distribution of the position. Moreover, we utilize the tracked position probability distribution to quantify the uncertainty in situations where the tracking is erroneous. We evaluate our approach for state and uncertainty estimation using GNSS-VO fusion on real-world data and demonstrate that our filter exhibits comparable computation efficiency and improved state and uncertainty estimates over other Bayesian filter baselines.},

The concept of reflectometry in space using reflected GNSS signals has been demonstrated in the recent years. While significant advancement has been made in the field of GNSS-based reflectometry (GNSS-R) over water, the focus is now shifting to terrestrial applications such as sensing soil moisture, vegetation and forest biomass. Several groundbased field experiments and airborne campaigns in the past have shown the possibilities to retrieve soil moisture using reflected GNSS signals. However, from the trends observed, there is a lack of emphasis on the need for a real-time reconfigurable GNSS-R receiver for soil moisture retrieval. The main objective of this research is to develop a reconfigurable GNSS-R receiver for soil moisture retrieval using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components. Two dual polarised antennas are used to collect direct and reflected GNSS signals and are processed in real-time with hardware modules implemented in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The developed GNSS-R receiver can successfully acquire, track and decode navigation messages from direct and reflected GNSS signals. Results from the conducted tests are presented and analyzed.},

So, the investigation on the relationship between the GNSS signal design parameters and its navigation performance is necessarily in particular at the signal design stage. Meanwhile, for efficient signal design, whether the designed signals satisfy all predefined system requirements should be evaluated at the signal design stage. To do this, trade-off analysis focusing on several selected navigation performances such as time-to-first-fix (TTFF), sensitivity, accuracy, robustness, and multipath performance is performed.},

Additionally, it presents research review on the use of UVs in locating wandering eprsons with dementia. The characteristics of this critical form of wandering--or eloping—are discussed. By using test subjects simulating individual lost patients with dementia, along with current Search and Rescue (SAR) operational methods, experiments were performed employing drones to find the wandering persons. The algorithm used to determine the drone paths is based on the analysis of incidents analyzed in the literature from the International Search and Rescue Incident Database (ISRID) which contains thousands of international and national police records on lost persons. The experiments revealed that UAVs, if used with the pre-determined path, could expedite the search process thus improving the survivability of the lost person. The paper considers the time needed to detect the person, duration of the complete mission, the differential longitude and latitude analysis from an Initial Planning Point (IPP), the time taken to find the test subject and the battery life of the drone. Challenges and recommendations are presented to inform future experiments.},

  abstract = {Terrain referenced navigation (TRN) has been actively researched as an alternative to the GNSS denied environment. The operation principle of the TRN algorithm is to estimate the current position by comparing the measured terrain heights with the digital elevation model (DEM). The problem of radar altimeter is the large footprint that induces large measurement errors. This problem can be eliminated by replacing the radar altimeter with a laser altimeter. Laser TRN expects more accurate performance than radar based TRN due to its small footprint. However, laser measurements are vulnerable to defects according to environmental condition. In this paper, we propose two methods to improve the performance of laser TRN. The first is to accurately model the laser measurement error using the Gaussian mixture noise model. The statistical characteristics of the laser measurement error are considered. Secondly we suggest an effective fault detection algorithm to eliminate the outliers in measured altitude. Large, irregular measurement errors severely degrade TRN performance and impair system stability. Proper rejection of outliers is a crucial factor for improving TRN performance. The fault detection algorithm consisting of the residual sequence check and stochastic terrain roughness check is formulated in the particle filter framework. Through simulation experiment we show that the proposed fault detection algorithm effectively eliminates singularities and improves the performance and reliability of TRN. The proposed fault rejection scheme is applicable to any kind of nonlinear Bayesian state estimators.},

A real-time-kinematic (RTK) approach is utilized where the rover and base station measure pseudoranges, carrier-phase, and carrier-phase derived Doppler, to be used in a dual receiver configuration. The modular observer design consists of a nonlinear attitude observer and a translational motion observer (TMO). The attitude observer represents the vehicle attitude as unit quaternions and estimates the gyro bias. A TMO based on the double-differenced measurements between the rover and base station receiver is proposed. The ambiguities introduced by the carrier-phase measurements are included in the state vector and are initially considered real valued, later to be resolved to integer values. The advantages of the nonlinear observer compared with a Kalman filter are reduced computational load, no linearization requirement of the model, and proven stability. The proposed observer is verified using experimental data from flights with an unmanned aerial vehicle, where the position estimates are shown to be within 2–4 cm of a global positioning system L1-based RTK reference solution.},

Our proposed method is completely independent of the estimation techniques used during the calibration phase and can therefore be used to evaluate the performance of the calibration. Additionally, we also demonstrate how to propagate the uncertainties of calibration and image measurements into the estimated camera position.

  abstract = {The growing demand for a reliable localization function in safety-relevant autonomous applications has prompted the navigation community to take a close interest in Fault Detection algorithms. Particularly powerful, these methods have as common limitation, the need to define a priori probabilities of fault(s) presence or absence in order to set a detection threshold. In the case of systems insensitive to external phenomena, these probabilities can be obtained although with difficulty. However, in a multi-sensor localization system using, among other, Global Navigation Satellites System (GNSS), this task can prove to be delicate. Indeed, these global navigation systems suffer from perturbations induced by the local environment (buildings in urban canyons, foliage in forests, intentional or nonintentional interferences...) causing local feared events such as multipath, Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) or GNSS outage. The a priori probabilities to face this type of event, and therefore to observe one or more inconsistent measures, are very unpredictable. This makes the task of setting a threshold difficult. In this study, we investigate the combined use of 1) GNSS expertise: allowing to identify the different parameters, making it possible to monitor the state of health of the measurements, and therefore of the global system, and 2) the implementation of a deep learning scheme, as a decision-making support, considering these inputs, and providing the adequate a priori probability of fault presence.},

  abstract = {The Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) is a Japanese regional navigation satellite system covering East Asia and Oceania region. QZSS is designed as a satellite-based augmentation system to improve the availability and performance of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in the region. Besides L1, L2 and L5 navigation signals, QZSS also transmits augmentation signals such as the LEX (L-band Experimental) signal, which is capable of transmitting precise navigation messages for high accuracy point positioning. A joint project between the Australian Cooperative Research Centre for Spatial Information (CRCSI) and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) aims to assess the feasibility of using the LEX signal to potentially deliver a precise positioning service in Australia. This paper describes a preliminary test for the transmission of a prototype “Australian-generated LEX corrections”. The research was performed in November 2013 and June 2014. Correction messages, based on the IGS and CNES realtime products were transmitted from Australia to the QZS master control station in Japan and broadcasted on the LEX signal. The messages were received and decoded in Australia and used to calculate precise point positioning (PPP) solutions. The time difference between the message’s time of frame (TOF) and the time of arrival to the rover receiver were compared between messages transmitted on the LEX signal and through a land network. The real time PPP solutions obtained from the developed “Australian LEX” system have comparable performance to those obtained using the IGS real-time products obtained through a land network, showing that latency and reliability of the system is adequate for real-time PPP. In the future regional orbits and clocks for real-time PPP will be generated and delivered through the QZSS LEX signal.},

  abstract = {In 2016, Google released an application programming interface on Android smartphones which allowed users to access the raw Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements. This recent accessibility of raw GPS measurements coupled with the rising demand for handheld navigation and tracking for consumer applications has created an opportunity to test the capabilities of a smartphone tracking system for river kayaking. However, GPS-only navigation can be intermittent or unreliable due to satellite signal outages in environments such as river canyons, therefore an inertial navigation system (INS) can be integrated to provide a continuous solution during these outages. In this paper, a system to continuously track a kayak through a river using a lowcost, smartphone GPS/INS based positioning system was developed. Low-cost inertial sensors, such as those found in a smartphone, are incapable of providing an accurate solution for a long period of time during GPS outages due to the accumulation of sensor errors. To overcome this, kayak-specific motion constraints are proposed that estimate the gyroscope bias, pitch and roll angles, and accelerometer bias with the assumption that the kayak’s pitch and roll angles are centered around zero, cyclic in nature, and return to the same orientation at regular time intervals. To evaluate this proposed solution, multiple field datasets were collected using a Google Pixel 4 that was fixed to the deck of a kayak. The experimental results indicate an improvement in the navigation performance verifying that the proposed kayak-specific motion constraints increased the accuracy of the solution during GPS outages.},

Traditionally, the ionospheric delays are removed to first order by using dual-frequency data. More recently, three or more frequencies are available from modernized and newly emerged systems. Most observation models assume the inter-signal biases for pseudoranges and carrierphases to be time-invariant. A violation of this assumption may be uncritical for dual-frequency processing in many cases, but with three frequencies the variations are not absorbed any more by nuisance parameters and may affect actual estimation parameters of interest. Coping with variable receiver biases is essential for many GNSS applications particularly for high-precision positioning where fast ambiguity resolution relies on the use of triple-frequency observations.},

  abstract = {A novel monitor is introduced to detect correlations in a Kalman filter’s pre-fit measurement innovations. The two primary innovation monitors used today – innovations Snapshot and Sequence monitors – are excellent tools for detecting system faults and biases. These monitors, however, are insensitive to correlations between a Kalman filter’s innovations – a key metric in evaluating and validating system assumptions and performance. A new monitor is proposed which is specifically sensitive to these correlations. The monitor evaluates the sample covariance matrix of a Kalman filter’s innovations over a finite horizon and employs a hypothesis test to determine if a modeling fault has occurred. The monitor is theoretically developed and then validated with two simulations. In the first simulation, correlated random samples are drawn from a multivariate Gaussian distribution, and it is demonstrated that the proposed monitor raises a true-positive flag significantly more often than standard Snapshot and Sequence monitors while maintaining the same false-positive ratio. In the second simulation, a Monte Carlo evaluation of a simple, two-dimensional, GNSS-like example is presented wherein the presented monitor effectively detects correlation modeling errors while a Sequence monitor does not. The proposed correlation monitor has potential applications in atmospheric monitoring, navigation receiver clock monitoring, and GNSS anti-spoofing among others – essentially any application in which correlated faults can occur.},

  abstract = {The autonomous landing of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on moving unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) demands precise spatial synchronization of both vehicle systems. To achieve this goal, using individual GNSS receivers and additional sensors for both vehicles and having the vehicles exchange their respective 6D pose via radio communication is a straightforward approach for mutual localization. However, failure of the radio communication or individual sensors can critically affect the safety of the landing maneuver without suitable additional sensors or fallback systems In this work, we present and compare two methods for estimating the relative 6D pose between a UGV and a UAV using camera systems attached to the UGV. The first approach uses a stereo grayscale camera setup with fiducial markers on the underside of the wings of the UAV. The second approach uses a single RGB camera and a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on synthetic data, which is combined with a pose tracking filter to improve the update rate. Requirements for the pose estimation system are an average position error below 0.5 m and an orientation angle error below 10 deg, while the update rate should be at least 20 Hz. Different experiments with a demonstrator vehicle setup are presented, showing the performance and advantages of the respective approaches. During flight experiments with eleven flyovers, the CNN-based system was consistently able to detect the UAV pose, while the marker-based system had detections in seven cases. The CNN-based system had RMS position errors between 0.19 m and 1.36 m, and RMS yaw angle errors between 1.2 deg and 7.7 deg, which is an average improvement of 0.33 m and 5.6 deg, respectively, compared to the marker-based system. In future work, the pose estimation will be tested in the control loop with an automated UAV and UGV.},

  abstract = {High-precision positioning methods have drawn great attention in recent years due to the rapid development of intelligent vehicles and automatics driving. Real Time Kinematic (RTK) is a classical technology to achieve centimeter accuracy in open sky areas. However, vehicles driving under urban scenarios are always confronted with harsh Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) environment. Surrounding obstacles like buildings or overpasses may cause signal blockages or multipath noise, making it difficult to achieve continuous precise positions with a high ambiguity fixing rate. Even in harsh urban environment, the height of road is relatively stable and could be served as a piece of useful information, but few studies use height information for positioning improvement. In this paper, we propose a height-constraint RTK method to improve the positioning performance cooperatively. In a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) network, the position information of cooperative vehicles is used to construct a height plane for constraining the positioning results of vehicles. To validate the performance of our proposed method, a field test was carried out in Beijing with a four-vehicle fleet. Under urban environment, vehicles only reach 53\% ambiguity fixed rate with traditional RTK method in average, but our proposed method can achieve a fixed rate of 68\%. The root mean square error (RMSE) of traditional RTK method is 1.5729m, but only 0.72m for our proposed method. Results show that the proposed method takes advantage of the height information and thus obtains a much higher fixed rate and more accurate positioning results under urban scenarios.},

The magnetic train localization is able to identify the correct track and can solve an along-track location on the tracks. In contrast to GNSS, the magnetic train localization works in tunnels. In order to prove the practicality of the magnetic train localization method, a comprehensive train experiment has been conducted. Therefore, a high-speed train has been equipped with 28 magnetic and reference sensors such as wheel odometer, GNSS and inertial sensors. Measurements have been recorded in urban, high-speed and tunnel scenarios over 2200 km in eight measurement days.

This allows for more efficient utilization, e.g., in situations with distance dependent probability of detection or occluded regions. The proposed method avoids previous algorithmic pitfalls that can result in a not well-defined PHD.

  abstract = {For decades, the existing GPS infrastructure has proven to be the gold standard for providing an accurate Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) solution. However, the system design does not allow for rapid response to new threats. A common way of characterizing the decision-making process, called the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) loop, can be used to describe how a PNT system can respond to threats. The system detects (Observe) a threat, analyzes it and identifies mitigation strategy options (Orient), selects an option (Decide) and implements the option (Act). The OODA loop for responding to a GPS signal threat has traditionally been a lengthy process that involves tremendous analysis and research. In addition, when a new signal, such as M-Code or CHIMERA are developed to mitigate new threats, there still exists the challenge of deploying the new signal. In short, the process of detecting a threat in the field, researching a mitigation strategy, and deploying the solution to the user, space, and control segment of the GPS infrastructure takes years to complete. However, with a re-configurable GPS constellation, a new signal or mitigation technique can be deployed quicker than ever. An on-orbit re-configurable GPS constellation provides new possibilities of accelerating the OODA loop. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) has been exploring the new capabilities a re-configurable GPS infrastructure will bring. The research project, titled Rapid-OODA, focuses on reducing the time to respond to new threats from years to days, or even hours. The Rapid-OODA effort involves research into multiple disciplines from network design, hardware development, and signals research. This paper will outline the machine learning application research and development of the Rapid-OODA project.},

  abstract = {We address the issue of user privacy in the context of “collaborative” positioning, wherein information is passed between and processed by multiple cooperative agents with the goal of achieving high levels of positioning accuracy. In particular, we evaluate the feasibility of applying a layer of encryption to a linear least squares (LS) algorithm for providing position, velocity, and time (PVT) estimates to a user based on information exchanged between neighboring receivers. The goal of such a scheme is to facilitate the requisite transfer and processing of GNSS measurements to achieve improved performance over single-user positioning, as demonstrated in the literature, for instance in mitigating errors induced by ionospheric propagation. Additionally, we wish to maintain that other agents or outside observers do not have access to the information required to locate a given user. We accomplish this by employing “homomorphic encryption” methodologies, in which fundamental mathematical operations may be performed on encrypted data to produce encrypted outputs, without providing access to either input or output to the agent performing the operation. The performance of the LS collaborative positioning methodology is evaluated both with and without encryption, and the results compared to each other as well as to the output of “single-user positioning” where information from other receivers is not used to mitigate the effects of atmospheric interferences. We show that the application of cooperative methodology results in an increase in performance under interference conditions, as compared to the single-user approach, and additionally that the application of homomorphic encryption to this LS approach yields little or no loss in estimation performance over the traditional, unencrypted cooperative LS algorithm.},

Particularly, proximity-based positioning is a range-free solution where a receiver computes its position by knowing where nearby receivers are. The main requirement, therefore, is that collaborative receivers need to share their position, which poses a privacy concern and potential limitation in the widespread use of such approach. This article proposes a scheme whereby encrypted positions are shared among the collaborative agents in order to implement a proximity-based solution that does not reveal the position of neighboring nodes. With the use of the homomorphic encryption, we establish a framework that will perform the required operations to obtain position estimates, while the information of any participating user or device will remain private. The concept is investigated and then experimental results provided to support the proposed methodology, showing equivalent performance to the case where no privacy-security guarantees are provided.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, global positioning system (GPS) has been used widely in land vehicles to provide positioning services. However, information from this stand-alone device may be interrupted under some circumstances such as: urban environment, under the tunnels, etc. In addition, low-rate sample time typically 1Hz is another drawback of GPS. Therefore, GPS receiver can be augmented with the inertial navigation system (INS) to provide faster positioning information. By fusing GPS and INS data, the errors are bounded and accuracy increases considerably even when using low-cost INS and GPS. This paper presents a method of INS/GPS integration where a loosely coupled model is formulated and an extended Kalman filter is then applied to estimate information about position, velocity, and acceleration. Experiment results show that the processing time is reduced significantly but the estimated errors are acceptable (less than 1 meters) when applying the proposed integration method under the good signal of GPS. The performance evaluation is also implemented on several road trajectories in urban city that the 3 meters precision could be reached. In addition, accurate positioning and navigation results are still available from 9 to 14 seconds of GPS outages with the position errors spread from 3 to 10 meters (RMS).},

  abstract = {The need for GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) signal and data authentication for civilian users and infrastructure has been well-documented, and various methods have been investigated for two decades, notably the work of Scott. This need has recently been stressed in Space Policy Directive 7, which points towards implementation of authentication methods. Recent work by the Advanced SatNav (Satellite Navigation) Technologies group at Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Space Vehicles has worked to address this need with the creation of the Chimera (Chips Message Robust Authentication) protocol. Chimera jointly authenticates both the navigation data and the spreading code of a GPS civilian signal. Navigation Technology Satellite – 3 (NTS-3) presents the opportunity to explore the emerging signal and data authentication methods given by Chimera and its variations. This paper describes several authentication experiments planned on NTS-3, including baseline Chimera, Navigation Message Authentication (NMA) only, fast channel Chimera experiments, Chimera with the Timed Efficient Stream Loss-Tolerant Authentication (TESLA) protocol for data authentication, and experiments using a post-quantum digital signatures algorithm. We discuss recent progress in implementing these experiments in preparation for the NTS-3 flight. This preparation includes implementation in the L3Harris NTS-3 payload and in MITRE’s GNSS Test Architecture (GNSSTA) receiver.},

The interoperable format is defined as an extension of Compact SSR, a highly efficient RTCM-compatible open format applied for QZS CLAS. The format needs to support the global-scale PPP service as well as nation-wide PPP-RTK service using the constellation of MEO/IGSO/GEO satellites. To support global PPP using a multiple satellite data link and multiple generations of GNSS constellations efficiently, the satellite grouping using multiple satellite masks is introduced. The consistency and the resilience of the SSR correction messages under the condition of partial loss of messages are discussed. For the case study, the format is applied to a global PPP service using MEO constellation and a nation-wide PPP-RTK service using IGSO/GEO and analyzed.},

We show that this theory extends, and provides a rigorous theoretical basis for, an intuitively appealing optimal-assignment approach proposed by Drummond for evaluating the performance of multitarget tracking algorithms. We describe tractable computational approaches for computing such metrics based on standard optimal assignment or convex optimization techniques. We describe the potentially far-reaching implications of these metrics for applications such as performance evaluation and sensor management. In the former case, we demonstrate the application of multitarget miss-distance metrics as measures of effectiveness (MoEs) for multitarget tracking algorithms.},

  abstract = {Autonomous vehicles rely on a variety of sensors for accurate positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT). Data from these sensors are typically provided to a navigation fusion engine where an optimal estimate of the vehicle's state vector is formed to include position, velocity and time. Sensor fusion is required due to the ever-present organic threats to satellite based navigation systems that limit autonomous vehicle navigation such as urban canyons, multipath, and privacy jammers. The ability to fully simulate a sensor fusion environment, to include GNSS and non-GNSS based sensors, is essential to efficient development and accurate characterization of sensor fusion systems. Spirent Federal is working to develop a full simulation environment where all sensor data, including GNSS data, are coherent, and sensor outages and corruptions are modelled to measure the effects on fusion algorithms. Our cutting-edge simulation technology is the first of its kind to truly offer a comprehensive development environment that allows for full system stimulation with the added benefit of reducing cost and schedule associated with real-world testing. This paper takes a systems engineering approach to show how to design and develop a sensor fusion system to pace the organic threat environment, how to characterize and verify the system through our advanced simulation capabilities, and validate the end solution against customer needs.},

  abstract = {The low-cost GNSS market is still dominated by single-frequency devices. Since a few years, some manufacturers also produce lowcost dual-frequency receivers. Typically, these devices and instruments are much smaller and less expensive than geodetic dualfrequency equipment. However, this comes at the cost of a poorer usability, and a potentially poorer hardware and internal signal processing, resulting in observables with lower quality. Furthermore, GNSS low-cost antennas have worse performance than their geodetic-grade counterparts, especially in terms of multipath mitigation. In this contribution, the capability of such low-cost GNSS devices for real-time and high-rate geomonitoring purposes is investigated. For this purpose, we assembled the low-cost dualfrequency receiver u-blox ZED-F9P in a small and light-weight data logger with very low power consumption, which is thus very well suited for field campaigns in remote areas. Static measurements are performed to test the measurement accuracy and stability. To determine the influence of the antenna type on the measurement result, different antennas covering different price segments are connected to the low-cost receiver. Beside the static tests in kinematic mode, strong-motion dynamic ground movements are simulated with a robot, as they occur for large earthquakes. All experiments also involve measurements with a JAVAD SIGMA geodetic receiver, that have been carried out in parallel -- these are used for comparison purposes. For the processing of the measurements real-time precise point positioning (PPP) is used, since this is the primary method of choice for GNSS seismology. We focus on ambiguity float solutions which are determined under real-time conditions using the Centre National d’Études Spatiales (CNES) open-source PPP software and the CNES real-time products. This work demonstrates, that even with low-cost GNSS devices it is possible to obtain a precision of few centimeters (and even millimeters over short time intervals). Thus these devices can be used to monitor dynamic ground movements at the centimeter level, which is a requirement for strong-motion seismology. However, it must be considered that the quality of the antenna used can have a significant influence on the results. In addition, ambiguity resolution has proven to be challenging when using low-cost antennas. Therefore, a more in-depth investigation is necessary to exploit the full potential of the ambiguity resolution, also with other software packages. However, we conclude that these devices provide an excellent basis for the densification of existing GNSS monitoring networks, as needed for strong-motion seismology, or atmospheric tomography methods.},

  abstract = {Positioning performance of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is usually greatly influenced by multipath of satellite signals. With multi-antenna equipped, GNSS receiver can improve received signal strength (RSS) and mitigate the effects of interference and multipath, but some signal parameters, such as direction-of-arrival (DOA), time delay and doppler frequency offset (DFO), should be known in advance. However, they are hardly acquired fast and accurately due to the low RSS of the GNSS signals. In this paper, we propose a novel subspace-based method to estimate DOA, delay and DFO jointly. By removing sub-carrier from the received GNSS BOC signals, different sub-carrier phases are provided to give fine delay estimates and make some multipath rays incoherent in subspace processing. Forward and backward smooth (FBS) is also applied to build a spatial and spectral cross-correlation matrix with rotation invariance. The joint DOA and delay estimation for all rays is then gotten from its largest eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors respectively. A repetition property is then established based on the acquisition and the eigenvectors. With the help of the modulation of GNSS signals, a fine DFO estimate is given. The method in this paper expands the steering vectors in space and frequency, so it could have a higher spatial and temporal resolution in multipath environment. Simulation results show that, compared with the SAGE, the proposed method has a similar performance in light-of-sight (LOS) environment, but has much more accurate estimates for multipath rays with relatively short delay.},

The HAS corrections are High-Parity Vertical Reed–Solomon encoded on the Galileo E6 navigation data in a format reminiscent of but not identical to many State Space Representation (SSR) formats. In this paper we present the HASlib which is an open-source library intended to facilitate the use of the HAS in R\&D purposes. HASlib decodes the E6 navigation data frames and outputs the corrections in RTCM 3 or IGS SSR formats, as configured by the user. This makes it possible to use HAS with existing GNSS receivers and PPP engines that do not natively support the HAS formats. In the first release, BINEX and Septentrio SBF are supported as input formats. HASlib is written in Python language and its design is modular, which implies that support for other input or output formats is straightforward to implement. This paper describes the architecture and main features of the library. Furthermore, proof-of-concept results are presented to show that the library can be run in real time on a miniature desktop computer and that the output is compatible with the open-source PPP-Wizard package for PPP computation.},

Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) odometry is extensively studied in the past decades to achieve this goal. However, almost all the LiDAR-based approaches are built on top of the static world assumption. The performance of the LiDAR-based method is significantly degraded in urban canyons with enormous dynamic objects. To tackle this challenge, we propose a coarse-to-fine LiDAR-based solution with dynamic object removal. Both instant-level deep neural network (DNN) and point-wise discrepancy images are adopted to deal with the dynamic points. The evaluation results show that a 19.1\% improvement of the LiDAR-based method in a highly urbanized area can be achieved by distinguishing dynamic objects from LiDAR scan while generating clean maps for real-world representation.},

  abstract = {Multipath is a common factor that degrade the performance of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), especially in urban canyon and indoor environments. Due to the reflection of surrounding buildings, multiple Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) signals will arrive receiver antenna with various paths, and the Line of Sight (LOS) signals parameters such as the amplitude and phase will suffer significant distortions and fluctuation. However, due to the random feature of temporal, spatial and frequency diversity across the signal bands, it is difficult to accurately characterize the multipath effect. In this paper, a new attempt has been made to characterize the multipath fading in navigation domain using GNSS direct position estimation (DPE) algorithm. Live tests were conducted in viaduct and urban environments in Shanghai with both traditional two-step and DPE algorithm. The results show the robust of DPE no matter the receiver is moving or static. And the navigation domain manifolds for viaduct and urban scenarios are compared to characterize the multipath fading. The results demonstrate the feasibility of navigation domain multipath characterization using GNSS direct position estimation in urban canyon environment.},

  abstract = {The United States has the largest and most diverse general aviation (GA) community in the world, with more than 220,000 aircraft, flying almost 23 million hours annually. Accurate and economic estimating the exhaust emissions of general aviation will effectively support the practice of mitigating the environmental impacts from general aviation. Fuel flow rate in each phase of the Landing and Takeoff Cycle is one of the necessary factors recommended by the International Civil Aviation Organization to be used to estimate the exhaust emissions. This paper explores statistical models of predicting the fuel flow rate of pistonengine aircraft using general aviation flight operational data, including the aircraft altitude, the ground speed, and the vertical speed. A machine learning technique is applied to adapt the variability of flight operational data due to flexible operations of general aviation and random errors in flight data. The Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and the Smoothing Spline ANOVA (SS-ANOVA) are adopted as the modeling approaches. The modeling results are compared and interpreted from the standpoint of general aviation phases of flight in the Landing and Takeoff Cycle. Both models demonstrate good accuracy in predicting the fuel flow rate. The CART model provides intuitive outputs by the phases of flight, and is more robust to flight data outliers. The SS-ANOVA model is relatively more accurate in predicting the fuel flow rate, and is better at explaining the interaction between variables. A robust fuel flow rate prediction model of predicting the fuel flow rate of pistonengine aircraft is believed to be practical and economic for GA exhaust emissions estimation.},

  abstract = {Weighted average temperature (Tm) is one of the key parameters to determine the accuracy of GNSS water vapor inversion. Aiming at the problem that the local weighted average temperature model based on machine learning method considers less influence of regional relative elevation, it is difficult to obtain meteorological data in the area without radiosonde observations. Taking three radiosonde stations in Poyang Lake as an example, the accuracy of nonlinear local weighted average temperature modeling in Poyang Lake area is analyzed by using the meteorological data provided by ERA5 data and introducing the relative elevation as the input of machine learning modeling. Two machine learning methods of BP neural network and Random Forest are used as the modeling method. When checking the internal coincidence accuracy of the model, the experimental results show that for the accuracy of the whole troposphere, the accuracy of BP-h0Tm model at Anqing station, Nanchang Station and Quzhou station is 15.12\%, 11.28\% and 14.22\% higher than that of h0Tm model respectively, and the accuracy of RF-h0Tm model is 16.73\%, 14.60\% and 16.16\% higher than that of h0Tm model respectively. In the two Tm models based on machine learning algorithm, RF-h0Tm has higher accuracy in the selected overall troposphere range. BP-h0Tm has higher accuracy in the single layer with the sounding stations. When using radiosonde data to analyze the external coincidence accuracy of the model, it is found that compared with the results of Bevis regression formula and GPT3 model, the Bias absolute value and RMSE values of BP-h0Tm model and RF-h0Tm model established considering relative elevation are reduced accordingly, and the system error and model accuracy are improved. Through this nonlinear modeling method, it provides an idea for obtaining a higher-precision Tm method in areas without measured meteorological data or radiosonde observations.},

VIO is subject to scale drift because it estimates forward direction translation using distant feature points that are generally located only in the forward direction. Wheel odometer measurement can be obtained from the CANBUS interface of most modern passenger vehicles and these provide reliable estimates of the forward wheel speed. In this paper, we present an innovative approach to incorporate wheel odometry and non-holonomic constraints (NHC) together with tightly-coupled monocular visual-inertial odometry using the Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF) developed by Mourikis and Roumeliotis [1]. The algorithm is first validated and tested on two publicly available datasets and then evaluated using real-world winter driving data collected in suburban and urban environments.},

Road tests in different environments were conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed methodology, and a study on the comparison between native mobile phone location output and our positioning service was done.

This is demonstrated using data captured during 3.4 hours of driving on a repeating urban test route over three separate days. The results are achieved without any aiding by inertial or electro-optical sensors. Development and evaluation of the unaided GNSS-based precise positioning system is a key milestone toward the overall goal of combining precise GNSS, vision, radar, and inertial sensing for all-weather high-integrity precise positioning for automated and connected vehicles. The system described and evaluated herein is composed of a densely-spaced reference network, a softwaredefined GNSS receiver whose processing can be executed on general-purpose commodity hardware, and a real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning engine. All components have been tailored in their design to yield competent sub-decimeter positioning in the mobile urban environment. A performance sensitivity analysis reveals that navigation data bit prediction on the GPS L1 C/A signals is key to high-performance urban RTK positioning.},

  abstract = {A novel outdoor Virtual Reality (VR) concept called Open-World Virtual Reality (OWVR) is presented that combines precise GNSS positioning and a smartphone-grade inertial sensor to provide globally-referenced centimeter-and-degreeaccurate tracking of the VR headset. Unlike existing augmented and virtual reality systems, which perform camera-based inside-out headset tracking relative to a local reference frame (e.g., an ad-hoc frame fixed to a living room), OWVR’s globally-referenced tracking enables a novel VR experience in which the user’s outdoor exploration is robust to extremes in lighting conditions and local visual texture. This paper introduces the OWVR concept and presents a prototype OWVR system with two candidate sensor fusion architectures, one loosely and one tightly coupled. Comparative performance is evaluated in terms of tracking accuracy and availability of an integer-aperture-test-validated fixed tracking solution. For scenarios with degraded GNSS availability, which will be typical for outdoor VR, the tightly-coupled architecture is shown to offer a critical tracking robustness advantage.},

  abstract = {Currently GPS is the primary source for all navigation solutions in the US military as it is relatively cheap and easy for a user to implement and readily available worldwide. However, the heavy reliance and investment in GPS creates several vulnerabilities in our military. GPS is easily jammed and manipulated by intentional and accidental means, which creates a need for other alternative navigation methods. One such alternative is computer-aided visual navigation. A main hurdle up to this point has been to establish meaningful and robust features for consistent and accurate feature matching between aerial and satellite imagery. Typical feature matching on aerial imagery results in a majority of features being placed on trees and other non-seasonally invariant features. The primary objective of this research is to test the effectiveness of using semantic segmentation as a way to create and force robust features onto desired areas of an image for the purpose of visual navigation. This involves testing several segmentation algorithms to achieve state-of-the-art segmentation results and evaluating the effectiveness of feature matching on segmented imagery. The focus of this research will be on the development of a near stateof-the-art semantic segmentation model for aerial imagery that can extract desired buildings from an image. The research will then focus on various feature selection and feature matching algorithms in order to compare the segmented aerial key features with a known database of features from satellite imagery. Current results show that feature selection algorithms such as SIFT fail to overcome the nuances between multi-source aerial imagery. Improving the feature selection algorithm will ideally allow for an increased quantity and quality of matches, ultimately resulting in a camera pose estimation sufficient to be a reliable alternative to GPS.},

  abstract = {Positioning in urban areas, especially with smartphones, is still a challenging task as buildings in the vicinity of the receiver can obstruct the direct line-of-sight to the satellites. In recent years, collaborative positioning has become a way to effectively mitigate common errors. However, as the extra path delays in urban areas are very unique for each user, it is crucial to find partners that have similar extra path delays so that in a double-difference approach, the errors will be reduced. In this paper, two methods are compared to see how the choice of partners will affect the positioning solution. We show that when choosing a partner with a high spatial correlation of extra path delays and performing classical double difference relative positioning, the solution is similar to a method in which for each observation, a suitable observation from another agent is found. On the contrary, if the spatial correlation of extra path delays is low, obtaining the position through the double difference method causes systematic errors which can be slightly reduced if combining the observations separately.},

NASA has set a goal to develop an extensible and scalable lunar communication and navigation architecture called LunaNet. For the flexibility and robustness of the system, the architecture is desired to have an autonomous and decentralized operation capability. This paper presents and demonstrates a decentralized and autonomous state estimation algorithm for SmallSats that provides positioning, navigation, and timing service, each equipped with a GNSS receiver, chip-scale atomic clock, and inter-satellite communication module. In the framework, each satellite individually estimates its own state and clock offset with a decentralized Schmidt Extended Kalman Filter by processing weak GNSS signal and inter-satellite range measurements. The algorithm is validated with Monte-Carlo state estimate simulations of five satellites at the hybrid constellation of lunar frozen orbit and the Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO). The proposed filter converged in all Monte-Carlo cases with clock offset errors below 0.15 microseconds and 1.0 microseconds in the frozen orbit and the NRHO, respectively.},

  abstract = {Typically, magnetic based Measurement-whiledrilling (MWD) instruments are utilized to provide monitoring of the position and orientation for the horizontal drilling processes in the oil industry. Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) based on low cost Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) for MWD system offers a number of advantages such as low power consumption, immunity to shock and vibration. However, their precision degrades significantly in short span of time due to residual random errors of the inertial sensors. This paper introduces a novel Bi-orthonormal Optimal Signal Search (BIOSS) based de-noising for improving wellbore continuous MWD surveying utilizing MEMS inertial sensors. This new signal de-noising method is based on optimal bi-orthonormal signal approximation. The simulated MWD data sets are obtained in a laboratory environment by MEMS IMU, which is mounted on three-axis positioning and rate table. The Inertial sensors measurements are de-noised by BIOSS with the performance being compared to the conventional Wavelet-based de-nosing. We use Allan variance analysis to identify the bias drift, random walk and other statistical characteristics of the denoised data. The de-noised inertial sensor’s measurements are processed through the reduced inertial sensor system (RISS) algorithm together with an extended Kalman filtering module for the update measurements corresponding to the length of the drill pipe and the penetration rate provided in oil drilling fields. The experiment results shown that the proposed method can significantly improve the computation of the position and attitude of the bottom-hole-assembly (BHA) while using denoised measurements from low cost MEMS based inertial sensors processed through the 3D RISS algorithm utilized for the first time for MWD applications.},

  abstract = {PPP-RTK is an hybrid positioning technique of Network RTK (Real Time Kinematic) and PPP (Precise Point Positioning). These two techniques allow to calculate the position of a user using GNSS data: each of these techniques has a real interest in the resolution and the determination of the position with a global approach. RTK method uses a Continously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) network to collect data. The hybrid solution PPP-RTK uses precise data as in PPP but accelerates its resolution by using data from the CORS network as in RTK, in particular to speed up the resolution of ambiguities. This solution is divided into three parts: the network part with the collection of different data, the user part which calculates its position and finally the corrections part which is the message that sends the data to the user to calculate its position. NRTK and PPP-RTK use the data of the CORS network for the position's calculation. The density of the network is generally around 50km between two stations. The density of the CORS network can be a criterion of performance between the wellknown technique Network RTK and PPP-RTK. The objective is to compare the accuracy of the PPP-RTK solution with the position calculated in NRTK in the same area. The set up of the comparison between both techniques used firstly, the all CORS of one region of the french Teria network. The choosen region has 14 CORS and each station is about 70 km away from each other. In this first study, both NRTK and PPP-RTK achieve centimeter accuracy in few seconds. Then, in a second time, the density of the CORS network is reduced : 140km between two CORS on average. The goal is to make the CORS network even less dense to see how the accuracy is modified by using less data for both NRTK and PPP-RTK. At the end, the position will be more accurate with the PPP-RTK technique in the second case thanks to the more global approach of the solution and the parameters. Also, this implementation would provide insight into the impact of ambiguity resolution on position.},

  abstract = {Man-made threats to Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-dependent infrastructures are constantly evolving as malicious actors strive to stay one step ahead of security safeguards. A GNSS receiver that satisfies a certain standard of resilience in 2023 may not be sufficient by the end of the decade if a brand-new or previously unknown type of interference emerges in the meantime. GNSS spoofing is a significant concern as it is an intentional form of interference that aims to deceive a receiver into accepting counterfeit signals as genuine. The technical challenges of spoofing GNSS receivers are higher compared to jamming, and the consequences can be more severe, as the receiver may use tampered signals for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT), resulting in misleading position and time information. This paper analyzes the potential impact of spoofing on commercial- and massmarket-grade GNSS receivers. The impact analysis is also be supported by an in-house open-source software-defined research receiver named ‘FGI-GSRx’. Additionally, findings from the real-world spoofing test conducted during Jammer test campaign 2022 in Norway, are also be presented.},

  abstract = {MICHIBIKI” (QZS-1), was launched on September 2010 as the 1st Quasi-Zenith Satellite in Japan. It has the functions to broadcast not only the same types of positioning signal as GPS, but also unique ones; “L1SAIF” and “LEX”. SPAC (Satellite Positioning Research and Application Center) has been investigating application of QZS system (QZSS) with our industrial partners, focusing high-precision “L1-SAIF” for Mass Market and “LEX” for Professional Market. This paper would be focused on “L1-SAIF”. “L1-SAIF+”, an expansion of “L1-SAIF”, is consist of two types of message; “SBAS-compatible” messages and “SBAS-incompatible” ones. The former messages are aimed for augmentation of satellite positioning signal, and the latter message offers other types of information: such as the message to shorten the time to first fix (TTFF) and the short message for disaster relief and so on.},

The objective was to gauge the RTK positioning capabilities of the receivers using the Minnesota Continuously Operating Reference Station (MnCORS) network. Position solutions were collected in rural, suburban and urban environments under static and dynamic test conditions. Performance was measured in terms of accuracy, availability (\% of time RTK is reported), continuity (loss of RTK lock statistics) and time to first RTK fix. Results show that low-cost receivers exhibit significant accuracy and availability degradation between different environments. The metrics degraded between static and dynamic testing, though the receivers maintained consistent performance relative to one another.},

  abstract = {One key challenge of integrating Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) platforms into the National Airspace System is the potential for midair collisions between manned aircraft and the unmanned system. The lack of an established UAS benchmark for Detect, Sense and Avoid Systems put the preponderance of avoidance efforts on manned aircraft pilots to visually see and avoid potential collision threats. The small size, unusual configurations, and diverse operational applications of unmanned systems make UAS platforms difficult to visually identify. This paper sought to determine the mean visibility distance of small UAS systems (sUAS) to an alerted pilot flying a general aviation aircraft in visual meteorological conditions (VMC). The study evaluated mean visibility distance to various small UAS platforms based on a scripted set of UAS convergence conditions. The study utilized a quantitative, experimental design in which a general aviation aircraft was flown into a UAS operations area. Study pilots were instructed to locate a flying UAS aircraft without bearing assistance. Both the UAS and manned aircraft were assigned vertically de-conflicted altitudes with the UAS aircraft executing a series of converging and crossing courses relative to the manned aircraft. The distance at which the pilot visually located the UAS platform was timestamped and electronically recorded via a GPS tracking device. The various conditions were statistically analyzed to determine significant visibility differences among the various convergence conditions.},

These methods are intended for implementation over large networks of GNSS receivers. We focus on jamming threats caused by personal privacy devices (PPDs). We first derive two new jamming detection tests to identify events of simultaneous drops in C/N0 impacting all satellites in view. To limit the risk of false alerts, we develop an automated process to model satellite-specific and receiver-station-specific C/N0 measurement variations under jamming-free conditions. These models are then incorporated in our new detectors and evaluated using months of GPS L1 C/N0 data from continuously operating reference stations (CORS). Tens to hundreds of events are detected monthly at CORS sites located next to highways. To confirm that the detected events are caused by jamming, we analyze CORS data over multiple days at multiple locations, and find patterns in jamming schedules. In addition, we process ADS-B-reported aircraft receiver data during two known radio-frequency interference (RFI) events that also impacted CORS data.},

We then validate this approach by developing a new Neyaman-Pearson locally-optimal signal power monitor using wideband radio-frequency (RF) data, and by deploying our own equipment at the locations and times of the predicted jamming. Two example wideband data sets are presented, which we collected in Colorado and Virginia.

  abstract = {Developing a universal pedestrian navigation framework that operates through extreme environmental conditions is essential. Such a navigation framework can enable Location-Based Services (LBS) in many applications, and one application in high demand of accurate and reliable positioning solutions is firefighter localization, primarily for navigating in indoor environments where signals of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) might degrade or fail, visibility is poor, and infrastructure dedicated to navigation is often not accessible. Jao et al. (2022a) reported a Pedestrian Indoor Navigation system integrating Deterministic, Opportunistic, and Cooperative localization approaches (PINDOC). The deterministic localization is a Zerovelocity-UPdaTe (ZUPT)-aided Inertial Navigation System (INS) enhanced with self-contained aiding approaches, including altimeter measurements and foot-to-foot ranging measurements. The opportunistic approach uses pseudorange measurements extracted from cellular Long-Term Evolution (LTE) towers and implements a Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based Synthetic Aperture Navigation (SAN) to spatially mitigate multipath. This approach operates in a base/rover framework, where a GNSS receiver and a "base" LTE receiver, both installed stationary in an outdoor environment, are used to estimate clock bias drifts of LTE towers, and the estimated clock biases are transmitted to "rover" LTE receivers equipped on agents navigating in indoor environments. The cooperative localization approach uses UWBs for inter-agent range measurements and differentiates LineOf-Sight (LOS) and NLOS components using a power-metric-based detector. In this paper, we experimentally investigate the navigation performance of the PINDOC system. Two experiments were conducted. The first experiment involved three agents, with one agent traversing in an indoor environment a trajectory of 600 meters in 14 minutes, during which the other two agents remained stationary. The traversed trajectory included terrains of flat surfaces, stairs, ramps, and elevators. The PINDOC system achieved a position Root-Mean-Squared Error (RMSE), maximum error, and loop-closure error of 0.93 m, 2.23 m, and 1.28 m over the 600-meter trajectory, respectively. In the second experiment, all three agents traveled in the indoor environment for 12.5 minutes, and the navigation solutions estimated by the PINDOC system showed loop-closure errors of 0.35 m, 0.82, and 1.15 m for the three agents. In all cases, access to signals of opportunity and cooperative exchange of information between agents were available less than 20\% of time for duration of the experiments.},

The proposed approach first leverages a Zero-velocity-UPdaTe (ZUPT)-aided Inertial Navigation System (INS) to map unknown UWB beacons deployed in an environment during navigation and then utilizes the localized beacons to bound position error propagation. An experimental testbed was developed, and we conducted two experiments to validate the performance of the proposed UWB-Foot-SLAM. Experimental results in the first experiment, which involved a pedestrian walking for 3 minutes and deploying two beacons, showed that the UWB beacons’ positions estimated by the proposed UWBFoot-SLAM had displacement errors of 0.28 [m] and 0.22 [m]. In the second experiment, a pedestrian traveled for 25 minutes in a large multi-floor indoor environment and deployed four beacons. The positions of the pedestrian estimated by ZUPT-aided INS had horizontal and vertical Loop-Closure Errors (LCEs) of 11 [m] and 4.5 [m], respectively. When our proposed UWB-FootSLAM was used, the LCEs were reduced to 1.49 [m] and 1 [m], respectively, and the covariances associated with the pedestrian position states were bounded after operating for 155 [s].},

  abstract = {GNSS signals may experience radio wave scintillation due to refractive and diffractive processes when propagating through plasma density irregularities in the Earth’s ionosphere. Scintillation can be responsible for signal degradation both in its amplitude and phase. The behavior of typical commercial GNSS receivers has in the past been analyzed in the presence of modelled ionospheric scintillation events. Here, the use of numerical or physical models was avoided. A systematic method was established to analyse GPS L1 receiver performance under scintillation conditions with the use of a Spirent simulator. The method is based on a systematic analysis of the receiver performance in response to different fade depths and durations. First, artificial signal perturbations described by simplified instances of fade depth and duration were superimposed on to nominal GPS signals generated by a Spirent simulator; to visualize a given receiver’s performance. Second, scintillationinduced signal perturbations were extracted from real experimental data and superimposed on to the nominal simulated GPS signals. The receiver response to perturbed signal conditions was characterized in terms of the probability to lose lock as a function of fade depth and duration.},

In contrast, relatively less effort has been extended to study the topside ionosphere and plasmasphere that define the outer limits of the ionized atmosphere of Earth. TOPCAT is a dual frequency GPS L1(1.575 GHz)/L2(1.227 GHz) receiver that allows remote measurement of electron densities of these regions. It is a payload installed in the UK Space Agency (UKSA) led pilot CubeSat ‘UKube-1’, launched in July 2014 into Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The payload was developed using simple commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components to permit a relatively low cost method to study the upper atmosphere. The technology and design were successfully qualified for operating in a LEO environment through a series of ground testing. Phase data collected by the receiver will be used to image the electron density of the topside ionosphere and plasmasphere using ray tomography. TOPCAT serves as a technology demonstration for a future constellation of CubeSats that will enable continuous global coverage and further research of the regions.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a pose estimation system which is called MPS, where magnetic field is employed as an information delivering medium. It consists of a transmitter part and a receiver part. The transmitter part is a circular coil with a driving resonator circuit that generates an AC magnetic field signal with a pre-designed frequency. We use multiple transmitters which have different carrier frequencies. Each magnetic field covers the navigation area and overlaps in space. A 3-axis magnetometer measures the summed magnetic flux density, and the signals are separated with FDMA. Magnetic vectors are extracted from the sampled signals. It is compared with the estimated vector obtained from magnetic vector grid map or magnetic field model. The optimized estimation pose was obtained using the least squares method. Incidentally, its implementation for achieving real-time control of unmanned vehicles is not yet studied. Under this motivation, this paper attempts to validate whether the developed magnetic positioning system works properly for real-time dynamics control of unmanned vehicles with various methods: using a PILS simulator and real system-based experiment.},

The major issue when combining DTOA and AOA observations is synchronization. A synchronization design for DTOA and AOA observations is thus evaluated. The positioning algorithm that combines AOA and DTOA observations is a filter-based approach. Based on the measurement errors from actual ADS-B signals received from real flights, simulation is used to evaluate the positioning performance of the proposed 1090-MHz ADS-B WAM with the integration of AOA/DTOA approach under two scenarios, namely DTOA alone and AOA combined with DTOA.},

The proposed framework fuses an inertial measurement unit (IMU) with GPS and 5G pseudorange measurements in a tightly-coupled fashion via an extended Kalman filter to estimate the ground vehicles’ attitude, position, velocity, and clock errors. Solution separation tests are exploited to detect and exclude faults from GPS and 5G signals due to transmitter failures and local threats in urban environments (e.g., multipath). Experimental results are presented to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed framework under different sensor fusion scenarios. It is shown that fusing 5G signals enhances the FDE performance of the multi-sensor system in a suburban scenario: while INS/GPS fails to detect faulty GPS measurements, the INS/GPS/SOP is able to detect the fault. Moreover, over a trajectory of 1.91 km traversed in 200 s, using signals from two 5G gNBs, the INS/GPS/5G system achieved a position root-mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.81 m and maximum position error of 2.17 m. The undetected GPS fault in the INS/GPS system increased the RMSE and maximum position error to 1.83 m and 4.25 m, respectively.},

The V-Ray antenna – as used in the Locata positioning system – forms tight beams that provide line-of-sight range measurements as well as azimuth measurements. To take advantage of these two types of measurements, a new navigation methodology –the position and attitude modelling system (PAMS) – is proposed for processing carrier phase and azimuth measurements via an Unscented Kalman Filter. The PAMS can output the complete navigation parameters of position, velocity, acceleration and attitude simultaneously via an on-the-fly initialisation. The indoor test was conducted in a metal warehouse and the results confirmed that the horizontal positioning solution had an accuracy of better than 5cm and an orientation accuracy of less than 0.7 degrees.},

  abstract = {Spoofing attacks are threatening the global navigation satellite system (GNSS). GNSS receivers are vulnerable to spoofing attacks because the power of received GNSS signals is very low and the details of civilian signals are open to the public. The spoofing attack is potentially more hazardous than jamming since the target receiver is not aware of this threat and it is still providing position solutions which seem to be reliable. The robustness and security of GNSS have attracted worldwide attention, and the anti-spoofing technology of navigation signals is in urgent need. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a parametric multipath estimation method implemented in the frequency domain for BOC signals. Since the correlation function distortion of the authentic and spoofing mixture signals is similar to that of multipath, we find the above method also has a potential ability for GNSS anti-spoofing. Motivated by developing a more feasible spoofing estimation and mitigation technique with acceptable computational load, we extended the method to anti-spoofing by means of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Both formulae and simulations are provided to evaluate the anti-spoofing performance. Experiments with recordings in real GNSS spoofing scenarios are also performed to validate the practicability of the approach. Results indicate that the proposed STFT-based anti-spoofing method is capable of estimating the spoofing parameters and then removing the spoofing effect from the tracking loop. In addition, when considering multipath environments, this paper discussed a way to classify the authentic, spoofing and multipath components in the composite signal by analyzing the characteristics of the estimated parameters. Thus, even in the degraded environments, the proposed method is able to identify the potential spoofing attack and minimize the false alarm rate caused by multipath.},

However indoor positioning has never been a fully resolved issue due to its complexity and necessity to adapt to different situations and environment. Inertial sensor and Wi-Fi signal integrated indoor positioning have become good solutions to overcome many of the problems. Yet there are still problems such as inertial heading drift, wireless signal fluctuation and the time required for training a Wi-Fi fingerprint database. The collaborative Wi-Fi fingerprint training (cWiDB) method proposed in this paper enables the system to perform inertial measurement based collaborative positioning or Wi-Fi fingerprinting alternatively according to the current situation. It also reduces the time required for training the fingerprint database. Different database training methods and different training data size are compared to demonstrate the time and data required for generating a reasonable database. Finally the fingerprint positioning result is compared which indicates that the cWiDB is able to achieve the same positioning accuracy as conventional training methods but with less training time and a data adjustment option enabled.},

Meanwhile, tropospheric turbulence, which causes negligible differential error, can also present itself to the monitor as an ionospheric gradient and therefore trigger a false alarm. Consequently, tropospheric turbulence, while benign from an integrity perspective, will nevertheless have an adverse effect on system continuity. To remedy the situation, a supplementary ‘time interval’ monitor is developed in this work to distinguish hazardous ionospheric fronts from benign tropospheric turbulence.

However, they cannot detect all ionospheric gradients due to the presence of integer ambiguities. These ambiguities cannot be resolved because the gradient magnitude is unknown a priori. Furthermore, the performance of such monitors is highly dependent on the reference antenna topology.

  abstract = {In this paper, we describe methods to account for loss of continuity (LOC) caused by receiver alerts and unusually high protection levels caused by satellite outages in Horizontal Advance Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (H-ARAIM). First, we derive receiver alert thresholds to limit the risk of LOC: the derivation starts from the definition of LOC and shows that detection and exclusion thresholds do not require separate continuity risk requirement allocations. Second, we develop a new computationally-efficient approach to account for the impact of outages on LOC, which is key for performance analyses under the assumption that H-ARAIM does not require pre-flight availability screening. Both of these contributions are implemented to predict worldwide integrity and continuity performance in the presence of satellite faults and outages.},

Developmental Test (DT) Navigation Festival (NAVFEST) was a first-of-its-kind GPS jamming test event held at Edwards AFB, CA in August 2017. Although other GPS jamming test events have occurred around the world, none have been accomplished on such a scale by the developmental test community which provides a disciplined, scripted, and data-rich environment. This paper will cover the necessary planning, safety mitigation, diverse types of test, and the overall jamming ecosystem created by the event.

First, the impact using GPS combined with GLONASS for Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) is analyzed using published measurement error models for both constellations. Worldwide availability of integrity for the combined GPS + GLONASS constellation is computed for a representative phase of flight involving horizontal guidance. These results are analyzed in terms of the potential operational benefits that are possible with the combined constellation. Next, the performance of un-augmented GPS + GLONASS is analyzed in a flight environment to study the navigation accuracy and integrity of the combined unaugmented signals. A number of flight maneuvers were conducted to understand the benefits of the additional satellites in view. The addition of Satellite Based Augmentation System (SBAS) ionospheric corrections to the GLONASS measurements is also studied as are the resulting horizontal protection levels of the combined constellation. Finally, the paper also discusses some of the challenges that remain in integrating GLONASS into an airborne receiver.},

  abstract = {Ionospheric effects on signals from Global Navigation Satellite Systems are potential threats in cases involving their use for augmentation systems. Such applications require highly accurate positioning, high system availability, integrity, and continuity in any ionospheric condition. A solution typically used is the Differential Global Positioning Systems (DGPS) procedure, that broadcasts corrections for the users around a given reference station. This procedure provides corrections related to ionospheric and tropospheric errors. However, even differential systems, like the Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS), suffers operating restrictions due to intense ionospheric variations generating delay gradients. Additionally, there are still availability issues that ground receivers may experience due to scintillations. In this work, the performance of DGPS is evaluated during cases of strong ionospheric variations. The emphasis is on the use of Detection, Identification and Adaptation (DIA) technique for quality control. The analysis shows that even in cases when the standard DGPS method is affected due to scintillation, the DIA-based approach remains stable and operational. For 3D errors smaller than 5 meters, the results from DIA indicate reductions of 80\% and 2,6\% when compared to single point positioning and standard DGPS, respectively. Therefore, the findings of this experiment indicate that, under the conditions considered, the use of the DIA approach in the DGPS might increase the tolerance of this service against the effects of ionospheric delay gradients and scintillation.},

To answer this, we fuse local object poses from a deep neural network to build a globally consistent object map under precise prior estimates from the VIO module. The contribution of our work is the representation of the object map with six-dimensional poses that enables a robot to exploit orientational, as well as positional information in the filtering formulation. We showcase that our method can output cm-level accuracy localization and mapping in a room-scale environment in our photo-realistic virtual environment.},

A DVS is a bio-inspired sensor that captures asynchronous intensity change directions called an event instead of the absolute brightness as a conventional camera. We propose an IMU-aided event flow estimation method building upon the recent work of the contrast maximization in which event flow estimation is solved via maximizing the contrast composed of accumulated events given spatio-temporal window. Specifically, we initialize a gradient ascent method with a closedform of optical flow computed from the current filter state. In the estimator, the estimated event flow updates the unscented Kalman filter in which an inertial navigation system (INS) propagates to yield prior information. The proposed method is validated through the challenging open-source dataset. The experimental results reveal that the proposed VIO notably decreases a position error accumulation of an INS when compared to the image-based VIO.},

  abstract = {Accurate positioning of a drone taxi during takeoff and landing is a very important aspect regarding flight safety. However, in an urban environment where the demand of passenger is concentrated, it is difficult to obtain a reliable global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signal. Thus, the positioning result is unreliable. Therefore, we propose an ultra wideband (UWB) network on the vertiport to replace GNSS to obtain accurate positioning. Since the positioning performance of the UWB networks depends on the placement of UWB anchors, it is necessary to optimize the layout of UWB. The optimization process takes into account airborne UWB ranging error characteristics and Fresnel hole effects that depend on the received signal strength (RSS) such that the actual positioning accuracy of a drone taxi can be well predicted. In this paper, the landing path of a drone taxi set as the tag, and the UWB anchors installed in the vertiport were set as the anchor,an we optimized the UWB anchors layout about landing path of the drone taxi. As an optimization algorithm, we propose a binary genetic algorithm using a multi-objective fitness function consisting the number and positioning error of UWB. Then, we conducted hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HILS) to confirm that flight controller that is deployed position estimation algorithm of optimized UWB positioning network complete the flight following the mission path. As a result, positioning error has simillar pattern to positioning accuracy of simulation result based on genetic algorithm and flight controller completed the flight along the mission path.},

  abstract = {Conventional methods for assessing navigation sensor performance focus on detecting sensor failures through the use of measurement residuals in a Kalman filter or Extended Kalman Filter. Additionally, even though there has been a considerable amount of research into sensor-specific online calibration algorithms aimed at estimating sensor model parameters, none of these methods consider the possibility a sensor model has been improperly specified prior to integration into the ongoing navigation solution (i.e., unmodeled biases or inaccurate measurement noise strength). Due to the growing interest in alternative, all-source navigation, there exists a need for a general, sensor-independent statistical framework for validating the specified sensor model prior to integration into the navigation solution. This research proposes a generalized sensor validation algorithm, in which sensor models are statistically validated using a novel online likelihood ratio test, while mitigating the risk of corrupting the ongoing solution due to corrupted measurements. This validation process is part of a larger three-phased framework aimed at managing alternative sensor model validation, integrating sensorspecific online calibration routines, and providing a means for online sensor remodeling instead of simply declaring a failure and rejecting its measurements. The proposed validation algorithm is developed in the context of the larger framework and its benefits are demonstrated and compared to conventional methods using simulated navigation data.},

These algorithms enforce a human gait model on the inertial measurements, in order to restrain the accumulation of sensor errors. However, in the presence of external transportation platforms like elevators or escalators, these assumptions cause the PDR to ignore the external displacement and it loses track of the user’s trajectory. In this paper, we propose a method for reliably detecting external transportation platforms in pedestrian navigation based on the acceleration bias estimation in order to be independent from bias estimation errors. Different acceleration bias estimation techniques are compared regarding accuracy and robustness. With the new detection technique 98.7\% of the moving platforms are detected properly. All elevators are correctly detected; only one escalator is missing because of too short acceleration phases during stance phases while walking on that escalator.},

  abstract = {In highly shared urban traffic environments, it is essential to protect Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) to avoid collisions with motorized transport. One approach is to predict the intention or the future trajectories of the VRU from their previous path in order to send warnings in case of danger, or even to brake the cars in case of using driver assistance systems. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the short-term and particularly long-term prediction abilities of the AI-based predictors assisted with environmental maps, if applicable. By comparing and evaluating the performance of Polynomial Regression (PR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Sequence-tosequence neural networks (SeqToSeq) applied on an open access data set (i.e., Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD)) as well as some simulated data, we can conclude that the SeqToSeq generally performs better than other methods (Average Displacement Error is 25\% lower and Final Displacement Error is 20\% lower compared to a first order PR). By adding the environmental maps (navigation map and diffusion map), the pedestrian’s turnings are better predicted despite the fact that there is little improvement on other metrics. This can be explained by an insufficient amount of training data involving environmental maps in this research work. Thus it is still promising by adding more training data with environmental maps in the future.},

  abstract = {Detailed surface images of the Moon and Mars reveal hundreds of cave-like openings. These cave-like openings are theorized to be remnants of lava-tubes and their interior maybe in pristine conditions. These locations may have well preserved geological records of the Moon and Mars, including evidence of past water flow and habitability. Exploration of these caves using wheeled rovers remains a daunting challenge. These caves are likely to have entrances with caved-in ceilings much like the lava-tubes of Arizona and New Mexico. Thus, the entrances are nearly impossible to traverse even for experienced human hikers. Our approach is to utilize the SphereX robot, a 3 kg, 30 cm diameter robot with computer hardware and sensors of a smartphone attached to rocket thrusters. Each SphereX robot can hop, roll or fly short distances in low gravity, airless or lowpressure environments. Several SphereX robots maybe deployed to minimize single-point failure and exploit cooperative behaviors to traverse the cave. There are some important challenges for navigation and path planning in these cave environments. Localization systems such as GPS are not available nor are they easy to install due to the signal blockage from the rocks. These caves are too dark and too large for conventional sensor such as cameras and miniature laser sensors to perform detailed mapping and navigation. In this paper, we identify new techniques to map these caves by performing localized, cooperative mapping and navigation. In our approach, a team of SphereX robots much like a team of cave explorer will adopt specialized roles to perform navigation. For a minimal science mission, these robots need to obtain camera images and basic maps of the cave interior to be transmitted back to a lander or rover situated outside the cave. The teams of SphereX robots form a bucket brigade and partition the currently accessible volume of the cave. Then the teams of robots attempt to expand their reach deeper into the cave and sense their progress. Imaging the cave interior is expensive and require use of high-power strobe lights. The images would be compiled into a 3D point cloud and meshed by the lander or transmitted to ground. Using this conservative approach, we ensure the robots are always within communication reach of a lander/rover outside the cave. Once large segments of the cave are mapped, the rovers may lay down a network of mirrors to beam sunlight and laser light from a base station at the cave entrance to the far reaches of the cave. These mirrors also help the robots identify a pathway back to the cave entrance. Efforts are underway to perform field experiments to validate the feasibility our proposed approach to cave exploration.},

Considerable efforts have been made to model the human induced perturbations to the channel and develop flexible models that adapt to the unique propagation environment to which the network is deployed in. This paper proposes a noteworthy conceptual shift in the design of passive localization and tracking systems as the focus is shifted from channel modeling to filter design. We approach the problem using random finite set theory enabling us to model detections, missed detections, false alarms and unknown data association in a rigorous manner. The Bayesian filtering recursion applied with random finite sets is presented and a computationally tractable Gaussian sum filter is developed. The development efforts of the paper are validated using experimental data and the results imply that the proposed approach can decrease the tracking error up to 48\% with respect to a benchmark solution.},

  abstract = {Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) have an unbounded type of error characteristics. In order to overcome this problem, aiding systems are used to fuse information obtained via additional sensors with the INS solutions. Terrain Aided Navigation (TAN) is an integrated solution method which exploits Digital Terrain Elevation Maps (DTEM) and on board altimeter data to aid INS in case of GNSS outage. In TAN applications, a position measurement is formed by comparing the terrain profiles, which are obtained by using on board altimeters, with a preloaded DTEM. In general, this position measurement is formed by finding the DTEM points which create minimummean-square error with the terrain profile that is measured with on board altimeters. Error on the formed position measurement varies with the terrain profile over which the airborne platform flies. This position measurement is used to keep INS errors bounded with various sensor fusion techniques, two of which are Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) and Gaussian Sum Filtering (GSF). However, error on the position measurement may cause these techniques to produce very erroneous navigation data or to behave in a divergent manner. Probabilistic Measurement Method (PMM) offered in this paper results with more probable position measurements which have less errors. PMM method is used with an EKF structure and takes advantage of position error covariances that are readily available within the EKF. Joint Probability Density Function (JPDF) of horizontal error components are formed and used while the terrain profile is compared with DTEM in order to form a position measurement. In this paper, performances of EKF with conventional positioning, GSF, and EKF with PMM are investigated and evaluated for 10 different flight paths. Flight paths are chosen to have different terrain profiles and the performance evaluation is realized by comparing the mean horizontal and vertical position errors.},

  abstract = {One of important applications of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in space is the precise orbit determination (POD) of satellites, particularly that of Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. Over time, progressively more LEO satellites equipped with GNSS onboard receivers will be in orbit. In order to satisfy both the absolute and relative accuracy of satellite mission requirements, efficient and precise determination of the LEO satellite orbits becomes a challenging problem. Currently, GNSS-based POD of LEO satellites can be performed using either un-differenced (UD) or double-differenced (DD) GNSS observations. Usually, precise absolute orbit accuracy of LEO satellites can be obtained using UD observations or high-low DD carrier-phases formed by two GNSS satellites, one ground station and one LEO satellite. The precise relative orbit accuracy can be obtained by using high-high DD carrier-phases formed by two GNSS satellites and two LEO satellites. If both UD and high-high DD observations are used for GNSS-based LEO POD, the orbits should be both absolutely and relatively well determined. Based on this motivation, we investigate how to use both UD and DD observations for GNSSbased LEO POD. For our investigation, we utilize real data from the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellites. The orbit accuracy is assessed using a number of tests, which include analysis of orbital fits, Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) residuals, K-Band Ranging (KBR) range residuals and external orbit comparisons. Both the SLR residuals and external orbit comparison indicate that the 3-D orbit accuracies are about 2 cm. The external orbit comparison also shows that the radial and normal orbit accuracy is better than 1 cm. According to the KBR range residuals, the relative accuracy between the two GRACE satellites is about 2 mm. Therefore, based on the proposed approach, we conclude that the orbits for LEO satellites can be precisely determined --with both absolute and relative accuracy, without the use of global reference stations.},

  abstract = {To protect civilian GPS signals from spoofing attacks, the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) has introduced the Chips-Message Robust Authentication (Chimera) signal enhancement for the GPS L1C signal. In the future, users with a compatible receiver can use the Chimera signal enhancement to authenticate GPS measurements every 3 minutes if only using Chimera GPS signals or every 1.5 or 6 seconds with access to a secure out-of-band channel. However, for fast moving vehicles, even the 6 second latency for the fast channel can be high, forcing users to choose between high-latency, authenticated GPS measurements or low-latency, vulnerable GPS measurements. In these cases, it is possible to use proprioceptive sensors, like inertial measurement units (IMUs) and wheel encoders, to validate unauthenticated GPS measurements and lower the latency of authentic position estimates. In this work, we propose using a factor graph optimization (FGO)-based approach to combine IMU, wheel encoder and GPS position measurements with the goal of mitigating spoofing attacks that might occur between Chimera authentications. We use the fault robust method of switchable constraints to introduce a weighting factor for GPS measurements. We use the value of the switchable constraint to indicate whether signals are authentic or not and include a regularization term to indicate that the presence, or absence, of spoofing is likely to be similar across intervals of time. We also introduce the Chimera authentication as a loop closure measurement in the factor graph which fully weights and uses GPS measurements for previous time instances when authentication is received. We experimentally validate our proposed approach in simulations, comparing to a naive FGO implementation, to show that our method successfully mitigates spoofing attacks and utilizes the loop closure to improve position estimates when Chimera authentication is available.},

  abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are a promising tool for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning in the presence of multipath and non-line-of-sight errors, owing to their ability to model complex errors using data. However, developing a DNN for GNSS positioning presents various challenges, such as 1) poor numerical conditioning caused by large variations in measurements and position values across the globe, 2) varying number and order within the set of measurements due to changing satellite visibility, and 3) overfitting to available data. In this work, we address the aforementioned challenges and propose an approach for GNSS positioning by applying DNN-based corrections to an initial position guess. Our DNN learns to output the position correction using the set of pseudorange residuals and satellite line-of-sight vectors as inputs. The limited variation in these input and output values improves the numerical conditioning for our DNN. We design our DNN architecture to combine information from the available GNSS measurements, which vary both in number and order, by leveraging recent advancements in set-based deep learning methods. Furthermore, we present a data augmentation strategy for reducing overfitting in the DNN by randomizing the initial position guesses. We first perform simulations and show an improvement in the initial positioning error when our DNN-based corrections are applied. After this, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms a WLS baseline on real-world data. Our implementation is available at github.com/Stanford-NavLab/deep\_gnss.},

  abstract = {Navigation solutions have become a vital part of our lives due to their use in numerous applications. Among these is land vehicle navigation, where navigation systems are embedded in passenger cars, ambulances, police cars, farming vehicles, fire trucks, among others. Two popular navigation systems employed in such an application are the Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Inertial Navigation System (INS). The GPS and INS have been integrated for their complementary characteristics to provide a more accurate and robust navigation solution than either stand-alone system. Based on the required accuracy, the simplicity of the desired system, and other factors, the two systems are integrated using any of the three common approaches of integration with the deepest level being the ultra-tightly coupled GPS/INS. The significance of research in this paper is two-fold. First, it introduces a new ultra-tight GPS/INS integrated system that enhances a receiver’s tracking robustness and sensitivity in challenging scenarios and consequently improves navigation availability. Second, it presents a novel GPS/INS trajectory data simulation podium. The latter proposed system can generate simulation data sets for all levels of GPS/INS integration and is used in this paper to verify the operation and performance of the newly implemented ultra-tight GPS/INS integrated system. The software receiver approach has been adopted as a platform for implementing the proposed algorithm; however, the proposed methodology can be applied in conventional hardware receivers as well. The performance of the suggested system(s) has been tested using a variety of simulation trajectory data sets in various conditions and scenarios.},

Experimental results with four LEO satellite constellations are presented: Starlink, OneWeb, Orbcomm, and Iridium. Two receiver designs are presented: (R1) a cognitive opportunistic navigation approach, which utilizes minimal, publicly available prior knowledge about the LEO satellite signal structure and (R2) a blind approach, which assumes no prior knowledge of the signals. Stationary positioning and mobile ground vehicle navigation results are presented. For the ground vehicle, results with two frameworks are presented: (N1) a LEOaided inertial navigation system (INS) simultaneous tracking and navigation (STAN) and (N2) a LEO-aided differential STAN. The results reveal the tremendous promise of exploiting multiconstellation LEO satellite signals of opportunity for navigation. For positioning: (i) with R1, starting with an initial estimate about 179 km away, by exploiting signals from 6 Starlink, 1 Orbcomm, and 4 Iridium, a final two-dimensional (2–D) position error of 6.5 m was achieved and (ii) with R2, starting with an initial estimate about 3,600 km away, by exploiting signals from 4 Starlink, 2 OneWeb, 1 Orbcomm, and 1 Iridium, a final 2–D position error of 5.1 m was achieved. For navigation, a ground vehicle was equipped with an industrial-grade inertial measurement unit (IMU) and an altimeter. (i) With R1 and N1, the vehicle traversed 4.15 km in 150 seconds (GNSS signals were only available for the first 2.33 km). By exploiting signals from 3 Starlink, 2 Orbcomm, and 1 Iridium, the 3–D position root mean squared error (RMSE) and final 3-D error were 18.4 m and 27.1 m, respectively. The GNSS-aided INS position RMSE and final 3-D error were 118.5 m and 472.7 m, respectively. (ii) With R2 and N2, the vehicle traversed 1.03 km in 110 seconds (GNSS signals were only available for the first 0.11 km). By exploiting signals from 4 Starlink, 1 OneWeb, 2 Orbcomm, and 1 Iridium, the 3–D position RMSE and final 3-D error were 9.5 m and 4.4 m, respectively.

  abstract = {This paper shows how to protect our skies from harmful radio frequency interference (RFI) to global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals, by offering terrestrial cellular signals of opportunity (SOPs) as a viable aircraft navigation system backup. An extensive flight campaign was conducted by the Autonomous Systems Perception, Intelligence, and Navigation (ASPIN) Laboratory in collaboration with the United States Air Force (USAF) to study the potential of cellular SOPs for high-altitude aircraft navigation. A multitude of flight trajectories and altitudes were exercised in the flight campaign in two different regions in Southern California, USA: (i) rural and (ii) semi-urban. Samples of the ambient downlink cellular SOPs were recorded, which were fed to ASPIN Laboratory’s MATRIX (Multichannel Adaptive TRansceiver Information eXtractor) software-defined receiver (SDR), which produced carrier phase measurements from these samples. These measurements were fused with altimeter data via an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to estimate the aircraft’s trajectory. This paper shows for the first time that at altitudes as high as about 11,000 ft above ground level (AGL), more than 100 cellular long-term evolution (LTE) eNodeBs can be reliable tracked, many of which were more than 100 km away, with carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N0) exceeding 40 dB-Hz. The paper shows pseudorange and Doppler tracking results from cellular eNodeBs along with the C/N0 and number of tracked eNodeBs over the two regions, while performing ascending, descending, and grid maneuvers. In addition, the paper shows navigation results in the rural and semi-urban regions, showing a position root mean-squared error of 9.86 m and 10.37, respectively, over trajectories of 42.23 km and 56.56 km, respectively, while exploiting an average of about 19 and 10 eNodeBs, respectively.},

  abstract = {A robust receiver design to exploit long-term evolution (LTE) terrestrial cellular signals of opportunity (SOPs) for high altitude aircraft navigation is presented. Conventional receivers employ phase-locked loops (PLLs) to track the carrier phase of received signals. In this paper, a Kalman filter (KF) is developed to replace the receiver’s PLLs. To evaluate the performance of the proposed receiver, a flight campaign was conducted over two regions in California, USA: (i) Region A: Edwards Air Force Base (rural) and (ii) Region B: Palmdale (semi-urban). It is shown that the proposed receiver provides robust tracking of received LTE signals compared to a conventional PLL-based receiver, in which the latter could only track intermittently, especially during sharp turns. The produced carrier phase observables to 5 LTE eNodeBs in each region were fused with altimeter data via an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to estimate the aircraft’s trajectory. Over trajectories of 51 km and 57 km in regions A and B, traversed in 9 min and 11 min, at flying altitudes of 5,000 and 7,000 ft above ground level, respectively, the proposed KF-based receiver reduced the position root-mean squared error (RMSE) by 74.8\% and 30.7\%, respectively, over the PLL-based receiver.},

  abstract = {The problem of obtaining a long-term accurate positioning solution in indoor environments has been an emergent topic in the world of business and academia in recent years. In the absence of information from the Global Positioning System (GPS), the inertial sensors within a smartphone can be used to provide a relative navigation solution. However, these onboard Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) based sensors suffer from the effects of different sensor errors which cause the inertial-only solution to deteriorate rapidly. As such, there is a need to constrain the inertial positioning solution when long-term navigation is needed. GPS positions and velocities, and WiFi positions are the most important forms of updates available for the inertial solution. However, updates from these two sources depend on external signals and infrastructure that may not always be available. Another problem specific to smartphone based navigation stems from the fact that a user does not use the device in one specific or unchanging orientation and the device is free to change orientation with respect to both the user and the direction of motion. To overcome these limitations, researchers are looking at other means of providing constraints to the inertial-only solution.},

  abstract = {In safety-critical applications, the vulnerability of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) to radio frequency interferences (RFIs) is a major concern. The development of a fail-safe and robust localization system now necessarily requires detection and mitigation of such interferences, which has increased with the proliferation of wireless systems and easy access to personal privacy devices (PPD) also known as jammers. Moreover, the advent of software-defined radio (SDR) permitting the transmission of customized and more complex signals has further complicated this problem. This paper provides an in-depth comparison of interference mitigation techniques at multiple levels primarily focusing on the safety perspective at the position level. For this purpose, the classical adaptive notch filter (ANF) and the wavelet packet decomposition method are applied to mitigate the effects of interference. This comparative study aims to assess the performance of these mitigation techniques at multiple levels (frequency estimation, acquisition, tracking and position). However, the main goal for the final user is to study the impact on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as accuracy, availability, and safety. Furthermore, two cases are considered: 1): interference in the absence of any mitigation strategy and after applying interference mitigation technique at the pre-correlation level. The complete study is presented for two different types of time-varying continuous wave (CW) interference signals namely frequency hopping and the chirp signal.},

The anomaly detection system is based on the High Rate Tracking Receiver (HRTR) software-defined radio (SDR) receiver platform, which provides a multi-channel tracking capability for all civil GPS signals on the L1, L2 and L5 frequencies. The current focus of the system is for detection of excursions in the carrier phase transmitted by GPS satellites. High rate post-correlation and tracking data from the HRTR are combined to detect carrier phase variations at a rate of up to 1 kHz. This data is used to calculate a metric based upon the Modified Allan Variance to detect step-like carrier phase anomalies typical of GPS satellite transmissions. Upon detection, information about the anomaly is recorded and ultimately archived in a database, which can be used for long-term analysis of anomaly behavior; additionally a short sample of raw data is recorded for each anomaly to aid post-analysis. The design of the anomaly detection system as well as the detection processing approach are described. Results from one year of operation of the system are presented. This includes summary statistics of anomaly behavior across the GPS constellation as well as multiple examples of detected anomalies. Results and discussion are also provided regarding the impact of these anomalies on traditional GPS receivers.},

Pseudorange measurements may additionally be smoothed with carrier phase measurements using divergence-free smoothing techniques, further attenuating multipath and noise errors without incurring ionospheric divergence effects.

  abstract = {Proper modeling of stochastic errors in inertial sensors plays a crucial role in the achievable quality of GNSS-INS integration especially with low-cost inertial sensors. Generalized Method of Wavelet Moments (GMWM) can model the underlying process for such errors with arbitrarily complex structure to obtain close match to the observed errors in terms of wavelet variance. In comparison to the widely used and IEEE adopted error modeling using Allan Variance, this method provides consistent estimation, ability to estimate parameters of composite stochastic models of much higher complexities, and considerably easier usage. However, the level of improvement in navigation quality does not necessarily grow proportionally to the fidelity of the error models. Therefore, opting for unnecessarily complex models may only increase computational load with no tangible gain in navigation quality. On the other hand, converging estimation of higher complexity models, generally speaking, requires longer estimation periods and higher dynamics to improve observability of error states. This implies yet another motivation to find an optimal sensor error model avoiding unnecessary complexities. In this paper, we employ two methods to investigate the effect of model complexity on integrated navigation performance. Firstly, a covariance propagation is performed on static conditions, as is the standard scenario in error analysis of inertial navigation systems. Afterwards, an emulation study is performed based on a real Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flight and error signals of a Navchip V2 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Results of both methods are in general agreement, and suggest that more complex models in general provide higher accuracy for the navigation system and a more consistent covariance prediction by the navigation filter. This difference is, however, more noticable only in GNSS outages of longer duration (tens of seconds). However, the benefits of more complex models may be only marginal in other applications, depending on the duration of inertial coasting and availability of other sensory data such as GNSS observations.},

This framework is based on a known receiver that tracks the LEO SVs using pseudorange and Doppler measurements extracted from the LEO SVs’ signals. A procedure to determine the process noise covariance for the LEO SVs’ motion is developed. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to demonstrate the improvements in the tracked LEO SVs’ ephemerides over open-loop SGP4-propagated ephemerides for three measurement scenarios: (i) pseudorange, (ii) Doppler, and (iii) pseudorange and Doppler. The improved ephemerides are subsequently utilized to localize an unknown receiver drawing pseudorange measurements on LEO SVs, and the resulting positioning error is compared for the true, open-loop, and closed-loop SV ephemerides. Experimental results are presented showing (i) a refinement of two Orbcomm LEO SVs’ ephemerides with reductions of 879.3 m and 817.7 m in their estimated position errors over SGP4 predictions and (ii) a 53.65\% reduction in the two-dimensional (2-D) localization error of an unknown stationary receiver by using the tracked ephemerides instead of SGP4-propagated ephemerides.},

These error models are intended for navigation integrity and continuity risk evaluation. We provide error models for code and carrier phase GNSS measurements under both static and dynamic multipath environments. The dynamic dataset was collected in realistic driving conditions for a vehicle traveling in an urban canyon and on a highway with overpasses and road signs. The static test was conducted in a more controlled environment, first, to precisely evaluate measurement errors under open sky, and then, to quantify the effect on multipath error of a semi-truck next to a car equipped with a commercial GNSS antenna. In this paper, we characterize the errors by the mean and standard deviation of a bounding Gaussian distribution and by the autocorrelation time constant of the measurement errors.},

For demanding aviation applications such as autonomous shipboard landing or autonomous airborne refueling, accuracy and integrity of carrier phase positioning and cycle resolution are essential. In such applications, the estimate error covariance matrix is used to assess the quality of cycle resolution as well as the integrity risk of the subsequent position solution. Therefore, any changes in the noise characteristics must be properly accounted for in the integrity risk computation. In this work, a monitor that detects sudden increases in the noise variance is proposed along with an explicit quantification of its effect on integrity risk.},

  abstract = {Integer ambiguity resolution at a single GNSS receiver gets feasible, if network-derived satellite phase biases (SPBs), among other corrections, are a-priori available. In this paper, the concept of array-aided between-satellite single-differenced (SD) SPB determination is introduced which is aimed to reduce the code-dominated precision of SD-SPB corrections. The underlying model is realized by giving the role of the local reference network to an array of antennas, mounted on rigid platforms, that are separated by a few meters only. A closed-form expression of the array-aided SD-SPB corrections is presented, thereby proposing a simple strategy to compute the SDSPBs. Upon resolving double-differenced ambiguities of the array’s data, the variance of the SD-SPB corrections is shown to be reduced by a factor equal to the number of antennas. This improvement in precision is also affirmed by numerical results. Experimental results demonstrate that the user’s integer-recovered ambiguities converge to integers faster, upon increasing the number of antennas aiding the SD-SPB corrections. Integrated with the ionospheric corrections, the stated SD-SPB corrections carry over the precision improvement to the user’s position as well.},

  abstract = {The carrier phase signals are considered the key observations in global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and several other high-precision interferometric measurement systems. Such ultra precise measurements are, however, not fully exploited when the integerness of their ambiguous cycles, the so-called ambiguities, is discarded in the estimation process. Provided that integerestimable functions of the phase ambiguities are properly identified, integer ambiguity resolution (IAR) can be utilized to benefit the associated parameter solutions. For the GNSS code division multiple access systems whose transmitters broadcast carrier phase signals on identical frequencies, such integer-estimable functions are the well-known double differenced ambiguities. This is, however, not the case with frequency-varying carrier phase signals as broadcast by, e.g., the GLONASS satellites, Low-EarthOrbiting communication satellites, or cellular long-term evolution transmitters. The present contribution aims to introduce algorithmic tools with which one can identify integer-estimable ambiguity functions, thereby bringing the observation equations of frequency-varying carrier phase measurements into the form to which IAR is applicable. Simulated results demonstrate, depending on the measurements’ precision and the number of epochs involved, that successful ambiguity resolution is possible and beneficial to high-precision parameter estimation even when one works with ‘frequency-varying’ carrier phase data.},

In this contribution, we study a single-receiver constant-velocity setup with which a reference receiver can act like a PPP-RTK correction provider, sending individual state-space corrections that are subject to time-delay. With the provision of the velocity components of the corrections, the user is enabled to predict delayed corrections over time so as to realize continuous real-time positioning. Numerical results demonstrate that an increase in the number of tracked satellites allows one to increase the corrections’ time-delay, yet ensuring successful user ambiguity resolution.},

Equations are derived that characterize the maximum dimensions of the AL when traveling on curved roads. On curved roads, the allowable errors in the lateral and longitudinal directions are coupled, so lane-keeping requires both a limit on lateral errors and on longitudinal errors (either or both of which can carry an automated vehicle outside its lane, possibly resulting in a hazardous collision). We apply our equations for characterizing elliptical AL to relevant scenarios involving vehicles of different sizes on representative roadways; in each case, we compare the performance of the elliptical AL to that of a rectangular AL, as has been considered previously by other investigators. Our analyses indicate that the elliptical AL always outperforms the rectangular AL, allowing for larger longitudinal errors, by as much as a factor of two for passenger vehicles on narrow roadways when lateral errors are tightly constrained.},

  abstract = {The SFOL pulse is a high accuracy DME/N pulse developed from using Genetic Algorithms. This pulse complies with the current DME/N specifications and is significantly less susceptible to multipaths than previous DME pulses. Recent analysis of the SFOL showed that the multipath-induced ranging error of the SFOL pulse was five times and two and half times less than the conventional Gaussian and Smoothed Concave Polygon pulses. To implement DMEs transmitting the SFOL, first, it would be desirable if modern DMEs currently deployed in the field can be modified to transmit the SFOL pulse without significant changes. It is expected that the biggest modification is required in the pulse shaping process. Currently, we are investigating a pre-distortion of the SFOL pulse for the typical power amplifier of a DME designed to transmit Gaussian pulses. A successful development of the pre-distortion may enable Gaussian pulse-based DMEs to transmit the SFOL pulse with relatively little changes. Second, the terrain in South Korea consists of numerous high mountains that would make it difficult to plan effective DME/DME networks due to the limited line of sights between DMEs and aircraft. Considering the airspace and major airport locations in South Korea, we are developing search algorithms that will result in cost effective DME/DME network layouts in the difficult terrain conditions. The paper will introduce a promising pre-distortion of the SFOL pulse and a strategy in planning of optimal DME/DME networks in South Korea with a recommended network layout.},

  abstract = {Network RTK is a navigation technology that can secure cm-level position accuracy using carrier phase measurements. The coverage of network RTK is known to be 50-70 km. The reason why the coverage of network RTK is limited is that the user's residual error cannot satisfy the integer ambiguity determinable level as the network expands. If the user's residual error can be maintained at the integer ambiguity determinable level, the coverage can be expanded. Network RTK user’s residual error mainly consists of ionospheric delay error and tropospheric delay error. Therefore, even if the network is expanded, if the ionospheric delay error and the tropospheric delay error can be effectively eliminated, the coverage of the network RTK can be expanded. Therefore, in this study, the possibility of expanding the coverage of network RTK was analyzed by suggesting the use of the Kriging based weight model and the determination of the integer ambiguity using the ionospheric free combination measurements. In order to test the effectiveness of the proposed method, the conventional 50-70km network and the expanded 100-150km network were constructed using the CORS reference stations, and the network RTK performance on sunny day and rainy days was analyzed. As a result, when the conventional methods were used, the integer ambiguity determination rate of less than 50\% was confirmed in the expanded network, and the position error of 10 cm or more occurred because the integer ambiguities were incorrectly determined. In particular, on the day with precipitation, it was not possible to secure network RTK availability because the integer ambiguity determination rate was decreased and position error were further increased. On the other hand, using the proposed method, it was confirmed that the integer ambiguity determination rate of 80\% or more can be secured in the extended network regardless of the troposphere environment. Moreover, it was determined that the coverage of network RTK can be expanded by checking the cm level position accuracy as all integer ambiguities were corretly determined.},

  abstract = {In urban areas, dense buildings frequently block and reflect global positioning system (GPS) signals, resulting in the reception of a few visible satellites with many multipath signals. This is a significant problem that results in unreliable positioning in urban areas. If a signal reception condition from a certain satellite can be detected, the positioning performance can be improved by excluding or de-weighting the multipath contaminated satellite signal. Thus, we developed a machinelearning-based method of classifying GPS signal reception conditions using a dual-polarized antenna. We employed a decision tree algorithm for classification using three features, one of which can be obtained only from a dual-polarized antenna. A machinelearning model was trained using GPS signals collected from various locations. When the features extracted from the GPS raw signal are input, the generated machine-learning model outputs one of the three signal reception conditions: non-line-of-sight (NLOS) only, line-of-sight (LOS) only, or LOS+NLOS. Multiple testing datasets were used to analyze the classification accuracy, which was then compared with an existing method using dual single-polarized antennas. Consequently, when the testing dataset was collected at different locations from the training dataset, a classification accuracy of 64.47\% was obtained, which was slightly higher than the accuracy of the existing method using dual single-polarized antennas. Therefore, the dual-polarized antenna solution is more beneficial than the dual single-polarized antenna solution because it has a more compact form factor and its performance is similar to that of the other solution.},

The cardinality refers to the number of elements in the data set (the number of the target) and estimation accuracy on the cardinality has an effect on the tracking performance of the CPHD filter. For that reason, cardinality compensation process is added to the filter, which is based on information fusion step using estimated cardinality obtained from the CPHD filter and measured cardinality obtained by finding the peak in the power spectrum density using the projection analysis image of a reassigned smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (RSPWVD). In the general CPHD filter, k-means clustering is used to calculate the cardinality. However, track loss occurs when there are severe noise and clutters in the measurement. Thus, FCM clustering, which is robust to noise or measurement disturbance, is also applied to the CPHD filter to reduce the track loss. The proposed tracking method is evaluated by theoretical analysis including simple simulations. It is confirmed that the proposed algorithm has better tracking performance of multiple frequencies compared to the conventional CPHD filter based method.},

Thus, these ionospheric anomalies need to be monitored by ground reference stations and users must be alarmed within time-to-alerts. The long-term ionospheric anomaly monitoring (LTIAM) tool has been developed to monitor ionospheric behavior continuously over the life cycle of ground-based augmentation systems (GBAS) and to build ionosphere threat models for all regions where GBAS will be fielded in the future. However, the use of poor-quality GNSS data degrades the accuracy of ionospheric delay estimates, produces many faulty anomaly candidates and thus adds a great burden to LTIAM processing.},

  abstract = {Recently, the demand for high-precision navigation systems for centimeter-level service has been growing rapidly for various GNSS applications. The network RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) is one of the candidate solution to provide high-accuracy position to user in real-time. However, the network RTK requires a lot of continuously operating reference stations to provide wide-area service for national or continental scales. Furthermore, it requires high-speed datalink for broadcasting their scalartype corrections. In this paper, we introduce a new concept called “Compact Wide-Area RTK (WARTK)” which provides centimeter-level positioning service on national or continental scales to overcoming the limitation of the legacy network RTK methods. Using the network of multiple reference stations whose distance is 200-1000 km, the Compact WARTK system generates three types of high-precision corrections: satellite orbit correction, satellite code/phase clock (CPC) correction, tropospheric correction. Separating each GPS error component into vector-forms, it is possible to broadcast their corrections over a wide-area using geosynchronous satellite with very low-speed data link under 500 bps. As the first paper introducing the Compact WARTK system, we mainly focuses on a satellite CPC correction generation algorithm. Unlike the conventional RTCM protocol which is very vulnerable to communication delay and failure, the compact WARTK corrections, which is generated based on multiple stations, are very robust against the latency and can be provided continuously even when a specific reference station is breakdown. Moreover, the quality of correction is enhanced even at low-elevation satellite. In order to evaluate the performance of the compact WARTK system, we conducted a preliminary test on mid-west and south USA with six reference station. Their baseline distance are 198 km to 921 km. As a result, the compact WARTK system has superior performance than the conventional RTCM protocol under communication delay and outage. It can still provide RTK even in 60 seconds time delay. In conclusion, the Compact WARTK system can provide centimeter-level positioning service within 1 minute to wide-area user while maintaining the hardware infrastructure of SBAS (Satellite-Based Augmentation System).},

  abstract = {Dilution of Precision (DOP) is used as a parameter representing the geometrical position of visible satellites, and as a measure of position error of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs). In previous studies, the Weight DOP (WDOP) was proposed by setting different weights based on the signal quality of the GPS satellite, and the signal quality of satellites was evaluated based on the elevation angle. In this study, Multi-Constellation Weighted DOP (MWDOP) is defined by expanding the weight matrix of GPS to the global navigation satellite systems (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and Beidou). The weight matrix is defined through actual data considering the elevation angle and pseudorange for each satellite system. Furthermore, the satellite selection algorithm is set up through sensitivity, which is calculated by dividing the difference between the DOP calculated for the entire set of satellites and the DOP calculated for a set excluding specific satellites divided by the DOP calculated for the entire set of satellites. If the calculated sensitivity is large, the excluded satellites are considered to have a large effect on the satellite positioning. This study provides more reliable criteria for selecting satellites by comparing DOP sensitivity and MWDOP sensitivity.},

Standard multi-GNSS is problematic because one satellite is defined as the master satellite in each GNSS, leaving insufficient numbers of satellites for positioning roles. Our new method uses QZSS as the sole master satellite. To this end, we solve the ambiguity of QZSS by the widelane method and the QZSS LEX signal, and preserve that double-difference (DD) ambiguity is integral number.

  abstract = {This paper introduces an IMU based context machine learning algorithm for terrain topography classification. Four different terrains are considered: concrete, pebble, sand, and grass. The grass terrain is further split into two separate classes based off moisture content of the grass, wet and dry. Separate terrain topography datasets are created by walking on different terrains and logging the data. The subject has been equipped with an IMU attached on the surface of the shoe above the toes. Data is collected and stored via a Bluetooth smartphone controller over multiple recording sessions. Acceleration, angular rate, and magnetic field were recorded. The recorded data is extracted in two second sliding window intervals, whereupon the magnitude of the sensor outputs, in three dimensions, is calculated. A low-pass band filter is also applied to the magnitude for the acceleration, angular rate, and magnetic field data. The magnitude output is processed in the time domain to calculate variance, energy, kurtosis, range, skewness, and the zero-crossing rate. The magnitude data is converted into the frequency domain and the peak magnitude and its corresponding frequency in the sliding window are determined. A set of 44 features is extracted from each window and then tested and trained to classify terrain topography using five different machine learning methods: Artificial Neural Network, Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbor, Naïve-Bayes, and Support Vector Machine. The 44-feature set is optimized using a wrapper selection algorithm for the Decision Tree and k-Nearest Neighbor algorithms. The results show that by utilizing sensor data from an IMU in combination with machine learning methods a terrain topography classification algorithm can accurately predict various terrains over which the user traverses.},

  abstract = {GNSS spoofing threats must be recognized, especially in maritime logistics, because many maritime electronic devices depend heavily on GNSS time, position, and speed for safe vessel operation. Herein, a multistage spoofing detection technique that combines two different algorithms for ships is proposed. This robust and stand-alone spoofing detection method is expected to be used for safe vessel operation and safe GNSS use in future remote vessel operations. Stage one involves pre-correlation level spoofing detection by multipath monitoring using a dual polarization antenna. On the ocean, most of the large delay multipath comes from sea reflections. Therefore, if the GNSS spoofing signal originates from a low elevation, its multipath will be caused by sea reflection, and its multipath characteristics will be the same for all satellites. These characteristics were estimated using SDR GNSS receivers for spoofing probability determination. One dual-polarization antenna and one SDR GNSS receiver are required for the first part. The second stage involves post-correlation level spoofing detection by moving-baseline analysis using two antennas and two receivers. When both receivers track the spoofing signal, its carrier phase had the same delay for all satellites between the two receivers. These phase delays were removed in the double difference calculation and the result of baseline length become zero. A spoofing detection algorithm was developed that applies this principle and required two RHCP antennas and two consumer receivers that output raw observation streams. The proposed method was evaluated on the sea environment and the algorithm was optimized for the ship.},

  abstract = {Highly accurate, robust, and reliable position determination is a topic attaining broad interest by the research community, since there are many scenarios and applications where current satellite-based positioning systems are not available or suitable, e.g. assisted living, robot navigation, and asset tracking. Improving performance and resource-efficiency for reliable and highly accurate indoor radio positioning in challenging environments is a problem of great interest. This applies especially if the number of anchors is scaled up in a large-scale deployment, and if harsh radio channel conditions apply, e.g. dense multipath propagation. However, little is known about determining the minimum anchor configuration to achieve targeted performance metrics. Robust and accurate indoor positioning can be provided by ultra-wideband (UWB) time-of-arrival measurements of the line-of-sight (LOS) component. To enable scalable real-time localization systems (RTLS) with an increasing amount of devices, reducing the number of nessessary rangings is of high importance. In this paper, we evaluate criterion-based performance metrics in harsh environments by applying a geodetic network optimization algorithm. We introduce fundamental performance metrics inside our UWB-network configuration through a radio environment map (REM). A REM is formulated, based on a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), to quantify for each anchor the expected measurement accuracy and reliability throughout the environment. These SINR REMs are used as an input for the proposed algorithm. The results show that radio environment maps can maximize the localization precision, while minimizing the number of distance measurements needed, which is highly beneficial for the scalability of location-aware indoor-positioning systems. The algorithm is evaluated by experimental measurements.},

  abstract = {The paper focuses on the use of GNSS constellation simulators for the performance evaluation of advanced anti-jamming and antispoofing techniques of GNSS receivers using multiple antennas in an antenna array. The use of antenna arrays and array signal processing enables a GNSS receiver to apply extremely efficient countermeasures to counteract radio frequency interference. This enhanced resilience to jamming and spoofing makes the multi-antenna GNSS receivers very attractive in the context of safetycritical applications. The paper highlights the advantages of testing such receivers in a controlled laboratory environment by utilizing the multi-antenna GNSS simulators. A fully scalable architecture of the multi-antenna simulator based on the use of multiple simulator units is presented. The simulator composed of 8 single RF output simulators is used together with a GNSS multi-antenna receiver prototype (GALANT) developed by DLR in order to obtain exemplary results for beamforming, direction of arrival estimation and spoofing detection in the corresponding signal scenarios. The obtained results are also used to highlight the merits of a GNSS array receiver as part of promising anti-jam and anti-spoof solutions.},

Because the attitude of the antenna array is assumed to be unknown and has to be estimated, the detection of spoofing signals is treated as a joint detection/estimation problem. For performing the field tests, a simple version of spoofing, so called meaconing, has been realized using a repeater of the in-air GNSS signals.

  abstract = {UWB–based ranging offers alternative positioning technique in GPS/GNSS-compromised or –denied environments. The UWB positioning relies on the set of static UWB nodes with known coordinates, called UWB network. The coordinates of UWB nodes for an ad-hoc network cannot be measured with alternative technique, such as total station, due to the short time window of the deployment. This is the case in many applications, such as navigating firefighters in a burning building or supporting indoor military operations. Thus, the UWB network has to calculate the node coordinates by itself using the mutually measured ranges among the nodes. Common solution is to use a central unit that collects all observations from the nodes, and then, it solves the network adjustment. Note that this solution is not scalable. For this reason, in this study, we assume that the network nodes share the measured ranges and other local information with their immediate neighbors, and this way, the need for a central unit is eliminated. Two distributed algorithms, namely the consensus subgradient and the accelerated weighted gradient methods, are investigated to solve the network adjustment problem. The algorithms are tested on three network configuration using simulations. We found that the accelerated weighted gradient methods outperforms the consensus subgradient methods in terms of convergence on the network adjustment problem, if global information of the network structure is available.},

  abstract = {The security of terrestrial radio-navigation systems (TRNS) has not yet been addressed in the literature. This proposal builds on what is known about securing global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to address this gap, re-evaluating proposals for GNSS security in light of the distinctive properties of TRNS. TRNS of the type envisioned in this paper are currently in their infancy, unburdened by considerations of backwards compatibility: security for TRNS is a clean slate. This paper argues that waveform- or signal-level security measures are irrelevant for TRNS, preventing neither spoofing nor unauthorized use of the service. Thus, only security measures which modify navigation message bits merit consideration. This paper proposes orthogonal mechanisms for navigation message encryption (NME) and authentication (NMA), constructed from standard cryptography primitives and specialized to TRNS: message encryption allows providers to offer tiered access to navigation parameters on a bit-by-bit basis, and message authentication disperses the bits of a message authentication code across all data packets, posing an additional challenge to spoofers. The implementation of this proposal will render TRNS more secure and resilient than traditional civil GNSS.},

Experimental results are presented showing: (i) successful blind estimation of the navigation beacon of the Orbcomm LEO constellation and (ii) a UAV navigating using the estimated beacons of two Orbcomm LEO satellites via a carrier phase differential navigation framework, achieving a three-dimensional position root mean-squared error (RMSE) of 13.9 m with only Orbcomm signals fused with an altimeter, over a trajectory of 2.28 km traversed in 2 minutes.},

  abstract = {A novel blind spectral approach is proposed for blind beacon estimation, Doppler tracking, and opportunistic positioning with unknown low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite signals. The framework is agnostic to the modulation and multiple access scheme adopted by LEO satellites. First, an analytical derivation of the received signal frequency spectrum is presented, which accounts for the highly dynamic channel between the LEO satellite and a terrestrial receiver. Second, a frequency domain-based blind Doppler discriminator is proposed. Third, a Kalman filter (KF)-based Doppler tracking algorithm is developed. Fourth, a blind beacon estimation framework for LEO satellites is proposed and its convergence properties are studied. Simulation results are presented showing successful beacon estimation and Doppler tracking of Starlink LEO satellites transmitting 5G orthogonal division multiple access (OFDM) signals. Experimental results are presented demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed framework on multi-constellation LEO satellites, namely OneWeb, Starlink, Orbcomm, and Iridium NEXT. Despite adopting different modulation and multiple access transmission schemes, the proposed framework is capable of successfully estimating the beacon and tracking the Doppler, in a blind fashion, of 8 LEO satellites (2 OneWeb, 4 Starlink, 1 Iridium NEXT, and 1 Orbcomm) over a period of about 560 seconds with Hz-level accuracy. The produced Doppler measurements were fused through a nonlinear least-squares estimator to localize a stationary receiver to an unprecedented level of accuracy. Starting with an initial estimate about 3,600 km away, a final three-dimensional (3–D) position error of 5.8 m and 2–D position error of 5.1 m was achieved. Aside from achieving this unprecedented accuracy, these results represent the first successful opportunistic tracking of unknown OneWeb LEO signals and their exploitation for positioning.},

This new approach passes the RFI together with the noise floor and the GNSS signals to the tracking engine. The signal stream will be analyzed and the influence on the correlator outputs (punctual, early, late, each in-phase and quadrature phase) will be estimated. The estimation allows a correction of the deformed auto-correlation result, before it will be further progressed by the discriminators of the tracking unit. The performance of this method will be evaluated by a basic GNSS software receiver under the stress of a personal privacy device (PPD) and an amateur radio signal of the 23-centimeter band (also Galileo E6) as interference source. Additionally, the results will be compared with the performance of the classical pre-correlation frequency domain adaptive filter (FDAF).},

Since then, SWACI has been continuously extended and improved and is now a grown up system with high accuracy products and dissemination solutions that forms the infrastructure for the present establishment of an Ionosphere Monitoring and Prediction Center (IMPC) at DLR.},

  abstract = {Autonomous driving is a field that has gathered much interest in recent years with significant research directed at solving the localization problem. To enable a fully autonomous platform, the navigation system is required to provide accurate solutions at high rates, and be reliable and always available in all types of environments. These requirements necessitate the use of multiple sensors, while maintaining an affordable cost to enable widespread adoption. Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) are commonly used sensors due to their self-contained and always available nature. However, pure Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) accumulate errors over time which limits their use to short durations. To overcome this limitation, a conventional approach has been to integrate INS with GNSS and odometry measurements to constrain the error growth. Such integration schemes can achieve lane level accuracy under open sky conditions, even when using low-cost Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) based IMUs. Unfortunately, such systems are not sufficient to provide accurate and reliable positioning in all environments, particularly in GNSS challenged or denied areas like tunnels and urban canyons. To maintain accurate positioning in these areas, perception sensors like cameras, Lidar, or radar, may be utilized to provide another source of absolute positioning information. This paper presents a multi-radar integrated version of AUTO, a real-time integrated navigation system that provides an accurate, reliable, high rate, and continuous (always available) navigation solution for autonomous platforms by integrating INS, GNSS-RTK, odometer, and multiple radars sensors with HD maps. AUTO uses a tight nonlinear integration scheme to fuse information from multiple imaging radars with the INS/GNSS/odometer solution. The HD maps may come from a map provider or be crowdsourced from radar data. The results in this paper compare multi-radar configurations of 1 to 5 imaging radars for vehicle and demonstrate the accurate solution achieved through the tightly integrated system. Furthermore, Key Performance Indices (KPI) are presented for a multi-radar configuration of AUTO for vehicle and robot. The results show how radar data contributes significantly with other sensors to provide a high rate, accurate, reliable, and robust navigation solution in GNSS degraded or denied environments and adverse weather conditions.},

A high precision positional measurement system was equipped on a vehicle in order to collect actual measurements and positional data at each measurement time. The data obtained by the measurement system was used as the reference coordinate for both the simulation and the actual measurements. Consequently, comparison between the simulation and actual measurement data on satellite visibility was implemented for the first time. A dominant deterioration factor of positional accuracy is Non-line-of-sight (NLoS) signals caused by reflection or diffraction from the buildings. If our simulation tells us that the satellites can be received as a Line-of-sight (LoS) signals, we will use the satellite in the real navigation solution especially in RTK-GNSS using the actual measurements data. This satellite selection method using 3D map was validated in this paper. Availability of RTK was improved more than 30\% near the building. In addition to the static test, we tried to predict the availability of car RTK based on the 3D map based simulation. The simulated availability of RTK matches with the actual availability of RTK to some degree.},

Skydel is a software-based simulation platform which can generate GNSS radio frequency (RF) signals that can be fed into a receiver, using a Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP). The experimental setup includes GNSS, and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), dynamic data collection unit in a ground vehicle, which is used to generate the test trajectory for Skydel. Skydel is then used to generate authentic and spoofed signals which are then collected using a GNSS receiver. Along with the previously collected IMU data, the authentic and spoofed signals are used to validate the optimal INS monitor. A spoofer’s uncertainty of user position (or position tracking error) is modeled as white Gaussian noise and added to the replica of authentic signal to form the spoofed signal. We show that the monitor is able to detect spoofer’s tracking error even at decimeter level magnitudes. As a result, the conducted experiments demonstrate the monitor ability in detecting realistic GNSS spoofing events even with minimal tracking errors.},

The example multi-sensor navigation architecture used in this work comprises of different sensors coupled with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) in individual Kalman filters (KF), where each filter separately provides its navigation solution. These decentralized individual KF solutions are later combined to provide the resultant navigation solution using a weighted fusion. In contrast to a centralized KF where faulty sensor measurements corrupt the navigation solution due to KF memory, the decentralized structure allows fault(s) to be removed from the resultant navigation solution instantaneously after detection and exclusion of the faulty filter(s). Solution separation among subsets of filters is used to detect faults and then identify the faulty sensors or filters, after which they are excluded from the resultant navigation solution. We also provide protection levels against faulty filters, which are identified and excluded. In order to readmit the declared faulty filters, we utilize solution separation techniques again to design a readmission test. This readmission test also allows us to reset a faulty filter in case the fault caused the filter navigation solution to be corrupted. We provide integrity risk and protection level formulas that account for missed detection, and wrong readmission. We validate the developed algorithm for detection, identification, exclusion, and readmission of faulty sensor using real sensor data set and simulated fault scenarios.},

In our prior work [11]–[17], we introduced an innovation sequence monitor that provided high integrity detection against slowly growing faults, but it lacked fault exclusion capability and assumed coincident monitor start at fault onset. In this work, we also prove that the solution separation monitor provides better detection capability compared to the innovation sequence monitor. The solution separation monitor enables direct fault exclusion after spoofing detection since the INS-only position solution is not corrupted by re-calibration using spoofed GNSS signals. We also address the monitor start and run time issue by proposing a sequential window monitoring method for which it is possible to explicitly quantify protection level for a given time frame of monitoring. For slowly growing faults which might remain undetected by the solution separation monitor we analyze the spoofer’s tracking error as an aid to detection. Wind gusts cause rapid movement of aircraft which cannot be tracked in real time and hence can potentially help with detection. We model spoofer’s tracking error based on empirical vertical velocity variation data of civil aircraft due to wind gusts. The solution separation monitor performance is shown to be enhanced with the presence of spoofer’s tracking error even when the spoofer does not inject any fault profiles.},

We implement the method and collect data at various distances and angles from the fiducial marker. The error distributions of both, measurements and estimates, appear Gaussian. At a distance of 1.75 m, with angles up to 60 degrees from the normal, the resulting position estimates have standard deviations in the sub-centimeter range.

  abstract = {Indoor positioning has attracted much attention in recent years due to the trend of Internet of Things (IoT), which is capable of providing numerous applications such as personal tracking, vehicle locator, and Location-Based Service (LBS). Since Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is no longer useful in the indoor environment because of the sheltered satellite signals, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a good alternative for realizing indoor positioning. BLE, the latest version of Bluetooth in 2010, has the advantages of low cost, low power consumption, and pervasive availability in smartphones. However, BLE still faces some challenges in terms of the fluctuating Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) caused by the environment such as reflection, fading and multipath effect. Those variable RSSI values make it difficult to derive positioning result accurately. To reduce the environmental effect, the concepts of Differential Global Navigation Satellite System (DGNSS) and Network Real Time Kinematic (NRTK) motivate a novel method named Differential Distance Correction proposed in this study. This method utilizes the differential information from the reference station at the known coordinate to correct the distance measurement of the rover station and further enhance the positioning accuracy of it. In this study, power regression model is used to convert RSSI to distance; then Differential Distance Correction is applied to obtain better distance measurements of the rover. In addition, trilateration is selected as the primary positioning technique, which exploits estimated distances to determine the target’s position. This technique can be solved by two main approaches: linear and nonlinear least squares. With corrected distance measurements, it can gain more accurate result through trilateration compared with simply using the original distances. The experimental results presented in this study illustrate that the overall positioning error using the proposed method can be reduced to less than 2.5 m in 90\% positioning error, and 2 m in RMSE with both improvement ratios over 30\%.},

  abstract = {All smartphones today have a GNSS receiver on board and most smartphones also have an LTE modem. The LTE Standard [1] regulates bandwidths, power, bands and other parameters of the LTE signal. However, there are many different LTE bands, and some of the bands have the second harmonic of their frequency range very close to the GPS L1 band. For instance, the uplink channels of LTE Band 13 and 14 have the second harmonic of their central frequencies at 1564 MHz and 1586 MHz, respectively. Considering the maximum bandwidth of the channels, the transmitted signal may be located just a few megahertz away from the GPS L1 frequency band. This close proximity creates interference conditions (“LTE jamming” here and below) for a GNSS receiver every time an LTE modem transmits something. The maximum allowed transmission power is limited by 23 dBm. The LTE jamming power, which a GNSS receiver gets at its input, is much lower than that and determined by the antenna isolation and nonlinearity of the LTE transmitter power amplifier (PA), which creates the second harmonic of the signal. The absolute power of the LTE signal at the GNSS receiver input port significantly depends on these factors, which are specific for any modem and hardware design, but none of these parameters are ideal. In addition, the paper shows that, in some configurations, the LTE jammer may be located too close to the GPS L1 band to be rejected by a SAW filter. The resulting jamming can seriously degrade the performance of a GNSS receiver, creating position outliers and even loss of position fix.},

The latter is designed to encompass dynamic information of the GNSS receiver. Two observation models are of interest: the first one considers the propagation delay and Doppler parameters, and the second one also including the Doppler rate, i.e., the acceleration, which is known to be relevant for high dynamics scenarios and can easily be included into the acquisition step. Within this context, the steady-state asymptotic performance of the tracking stage is obtained by solving an algebraic discrete Riccati equation. In both cases, simulation results are provided to show the validity of the proposed approach and the resulting steady-state performance.},

These observations permit geo-referenced characterization of terrestrial GNSS interference, which is an important step on the way to understanding the extent of the phenomenon and developing mitigation strategies. By working directly on 100 Hz data-wiped complex IQ correlation products instead of lower-frequency receiver products, it is possible to identify interference with greater sensitivity, permitting detection not long after it is first received. Successive ground passes of the Fast, Orbital, TEC, Observables, and Navigation (FOTON) receiver aboard the International Space Station (ISS) form an impressively complete GNSS interference survey of the globe at latitudes below the ISS inclination of 51.6 degrees.},

  abstract = {The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) real-time kinematics (RTK) is a high-precision positioning technique that has been widely used as a versatile surveying tool. However, RTK becomes invalid in GNSS-denied areas due to signal blockage. The GNSS is thus often used in combination with inertial navigation system (INS) to obtain greater utility during GNSS signal outages, while GNSS/INS integrated systems still suffer from the rapid accumulation of INS navigation errors over time, especially for low-cost systems. In this work, we aim to extend the high-precision RTK positioning capability to GNSS-denied areas by using a low-cost inertia-aided positioning pole that contains a dollar-level inertial measurement unit (IMU) chip and an RTK receiver. The key to maintaining the positioning accuracy at an acceptable level is to manipulate the pole as a walking stick, in which case, the pole tip lands on the ground periodically. The pole tip velocity is zero when it maintains contact with the solid ground, and thus, lever-arm compensated zero-velocity updates (LA-ZUPTs) can be utilized to suppress INS navigation errors effectively in GNSS-denied areas. In addition, the coordinate updates (CUPTs) of RTK positioning are used at RTK-friendly positions to provide strict geometric constraints and reduce INS errors. Furthermore, INS-based filtering, along with a smoothing algorithm, is applied in postprocessing to further reduce the INS positioning error. Regularly aided by LA-ZUPTs and enhanced by the smoothing algorithm, the INS is able to maintain centimeter-level positioning accuracy in postprocessing when the operator walks through GNSS-denied areas over short distances. The experimental results show that the positioning accuracy can be maintained at 5 cm and 8 cm in terms of root-meansquare error (RMSE) for I-shaped surveying trajectories of 20 meters and L-shaped surveying trajectories of 20 meters through GNSS-denied areas, respectively. In addition, the combination of forward and reverse measurements can further improve the positioning robustness and lead to an accuracy improvement of over 40\%. Therefore, it is feasible to use a low-cost inertia-aided positioning pole to bridge the GNSS gap and extend the RTK survey ability to GNSS-denied areas within a certain distance.},

  abstract = {We present a decentralized filtering architecture for integrated navigation systems with a large number of redundant measurements. The architecture proposed consists of decentralizing the sensor fusion algorithm into a bank of local filters whose output is blended by a master filter using covariance intersection. The problem of isolating a failed sensor is transformed into a problem of excluding failed filters from fusion. Each local filter includes its own fault detection algorithm which is used to alter the weight assigned to the local filters by the master filter. Decentralization contains the impact of a sensor failure in the corresponding local filter and prevents the failure from corrupting the final navigation system output. The performance of the proposed sensor fusion scheme is validated using a simulation study consisting of an INS/Beacon system with 23 sensors. The results from decentralized filters are compared with a centralized filter in the presence and absence of faults. While a centralized filter is seen to have a better accuracy during normal operations, its continuity is compromised when fault occurs. Results show the effectiveness of using simple fault detection and exclusion strategies along with covariance intersection to automatically detect a failed sensor and exclude it in a timely manner. Additional comparative results are presented to highlight the importance of optimal sensor allotment during decentralization. The decentralized filter architecture presented here can support many sensor inputs, hence these algorithms can be used for autonomous systems with a large array of sensors such as multi-constellation GNSS positioning.},

Analysis and Monte Carlo simulations are used to asses and characterize the impact of the number of local filters, state vector dimensions and magnitude of correlation between the local filters on the false alarm rate and protection levels observed in the fused solution. It is shown that poorly modeled inter-filter correlations can lead to higher false alarm rates than expected and errors in protection level calculations, hence increasing the integrity and continuity risk in the system.

One of the practical challenges involved in the use of a Kalman filtering based approach is the assumption of a well defined model of the process and measurement noise covariances, but this information is not directly available a priori and may change as channel conditions change during system operation. In this article, we propose a fully Bayesian methodology to estimate the measurement noise covariance at the same time that filtering takes place. An algorithm is proposed, which is validated through computer simulations.},

The bounds on 𝜎2 and 𝜏 are known. Reference [1] derives an overbound for the continuous-time KF, and we extend the result to the more common case of sampled-data systems with discrete-time measurements. We prove that the KF covariance matrix overbounds the estimate error distribution when Gauss-Markov processes are defined using a time constant 𝜏max and a process noise variance inflated by (𝜏max⁄𝜏min). We also show that the overbound is tightest by initializing the variance of the Gauss-Markov process with 𝜎02 = 2𝜎m2 ax⁄[1 + (𝜏min⁄𝜏max)]. The new method is evaluated using covariance analysis for an example application in advanced receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (ARAIM) [2].},

A closed form expression does not exist for HPL in the general case of non-zero mean estimate errors, and numerical methods must be used to determine an approximate protection level. For navigation applications, a computed HPL that upper bounds the true HPL is often desired. Current methods either do not guarantee that this condition is met or do not allow control over the tightness of the bound. In response, we derive a new approach for computing an upper bound on the true HPL that is simple to implement and is guaranteed to achieve a predefined relative error tolerance. The bound is obtained by approximating the circular integration region that defines HPL with rectangular elements. An analytical expression is derived that allows one to determine, a priori, the minimum number of rectangles needed to achieve the desired error tolerance, thereby minimizing the amount of computational effort required to compute the bound. Simulation results for a simple example validate the theoretical results in the paper, and MATLAB source code for the new method is provided.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the adaptation of an algorithm, originally designed to detect a ramp deviation in a Wiener process, to spoofing detection in global navigation satellite system (GNSS, e.g., GPS) receivers. Imperfectly compensated spoofing signals exhibit common-mode errors across all signals broadcast by a single transmitter, driven by inaccurate compensation of the spoofer-to-receiver transmission channel (range and range rate). Those common-mode delay and frequency errors can affect the clock bias and frequency estimates that the victim receiver calculates to estimate its position, velocity, and time (PVT). In a benign situation (i.e., no spoofing), the change in clock bias and frequency drift over time is determined primarily by the receiver’s oscillator. Given that frequency drift is typically modeled as a Wiener process, our hypothesis was that the algorithm in [1] could be adapted to detect spoofer-induced deviations of clock frequency drift from the nominally expected stochastic behavior.},

  abstract = {INS/GPS and INS/ZUPT techniques are complementary for pedestrian navigation applications. For optimal use of INS/ZUPT, the MEMS sensors are best mounted on a foot of a user, since the foot can periodically become stationary, thus applying ZUPT. For GPS/INS based module is best mounted on the upper body of the user, so that the user’s body does not block the GPS signals. In this paper, we propose a new solution for a pedestrian navigation scheme to fuse the information from the two systems. When both systems are used at the same time, a constraint that a spatial maximal distance of 1.5 m between the positions estimates of the two systems exists. Through exploring this external information, the state constraint Kalman filter was used to minimize the positioning errors of both systems. The experimental results show that when GPS is available, the INS/ZUPT sub-system’s positioning errors could be well bounded; on the other hand, when GPS signal is not available (simulated), the INS/GPS sub-system’s positioning accuracy could also be significantly improved.},

The use of low-cost MEMS (micro-electromechanical system) inertial sensors and GNSS (global navigation satellite system) receivers are widespread in this industry. To perform ZUPT (zero velocity update) measurement update for the navigation filter to correct PVA (position, velocity, attitude) errors of a typical inertial navigation system (INS) using inertial sensors, in this paper, a method of detecting ZUPT phases of a typical ground vehicle is proposed based on machine learning. The algorithm detects stationary and dynamic movements of vehicles through SVM (support vector machine), which is well-known for solving binary classification problems. The proposed SVM-based ZUPT detection approach can improve the accuracy of a GNSS/INS integrated system by replacing the traditional threshold-based detector. The test and results indicate that the proposed method could recognize the ZUPT phases of a vehicle with high efficiency and accuracy.},

  abstract = {The secondary codes of the modern GNSS signals bring some notable advantages, however they constitute a challenge for the acquisition process. Indeed, it becomes much more difficult to extend the coherent integration time with these codes. Several methods have been proposed for increasing the coherent integration time when there is a secondary code. Basically, the methods fall into two categories : 1) Methods with long coherent integration times, which require synchronization with the secondary code and imply a significant computational burden, and 2) Methods with short coherent integration times, which test all possible combinations for the secondary code. Since this leads to an exponential increase in the number of combinations, the coherent integration time remains limited, while non-coherent integrations are not usable. Therefore, there is currently no effective solution with intermediate coherent integration time, which would enable moderate to high sensitivity, while maintaining a reasonable level of complexity. In this paper, a method is proposed to address this problem. The method combines secondary code correlations to reduce the number of possible secondary code delays and reduce the complexity. In exchange, there is a loss in the signal-to-noise ratio as compared to the full secondary code correlation. It is shown that the proposed method offers similar or better performance than the short integration times method, in addition to offering the possibility of using non-coherent integrations, and offers lower complexity than the traditional long integration times method with greater sensitivity.},

While the spoofing profiles, which basically describe the inflicting signal shapes affecting the GPS observables, have already been analyzed in our previous research with respect to attacks against timing, this paper still utilizes the idea, yet implements and showcases the applicability of spoofing profiles in position domain. The extension, in fact, brings the idea of joint TSA and spatial spoofing. To jointly consider the time and spatial domains, the pseudorange and range rate equations are linearized with a non-conventional method. An antispoofing technique capable of withstanding TSAs, spatial attacks on single coordinate, and joint attacks is developed for stationary receiver. To validate the proposed approach, we utilize pre-recorded authentic GPS signals in the TEXBAT database for data transmission, which are captured by the Software Defined Radio receiver developed at UTSA. The algorithm is validated in simulations introducing synthetic spoofing and compared against Weighted Least Squares.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the number of smartphones with onboard Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) chipsets has been increasing. Although the navigation engines inside these phones use information from the GNSS chipsets as well as other sources of location such as network positioning, they are still vulnerable to GNSS spoofing. GNSS spoofing refers to the temperance of GNSS receivers using artificial GNSS signals to provide misleading positions, velocities, or time information. Failure to detect the presence of GNSS spoofing may result in the breach of integrity for systems using the navigation information from the GNSS receivers. There are several potential methods to detect GNSS spoofing for smartphones, including finding anomalies in the raw GNSS measurements and comparing the GNSS-based navigation solutions to inertial sensors. In this study, we explore the potential of utilizing the barometers inside smartphones to detect instances of GNSS spoofing. The advantages of using a barometer compared to other onboard GNSS-independent sensors include its potential to provide altitudes relative to the mean sea level, and its ability to provide high accuracy altitude rate data. In order to assess the capability of the barometers in GNSS spoofing detection, we assess the noise performances of both the barometers and the GNSS chipsets onboard smartphones under dynamic scenarios, and derive the thresholds for the discrepancy between the two sensors to establish acceptable levels of false detection. The novelty of this study lies in the improvement of the probability of false detection through local pressure corrections, carrier phase cycle slip mitigation, and filtering of both barometer and GNSS measurements using moving averaging and Kalman Filtering. Also, in the absence of local pressure corrections, the expected discrepancy bounds between the barometer, GNSS receiver, and truth due to spatial and temporal pressure variations are established as well. After the characterization of the thresholds, their performances are tested under real driving scenarios to simulate actual situations.},

To verify the proposed algorithm, a comprehensivesimulator is designed, and the results are compared between flight scenarios.

  abstract = {Navigation and timing based on GNSS receivers is widely used in many space missions. The use of multi-constellation and multi-frequency GNSS receivers are expanded to various altitudes of space mission including the GEO mission. However, a GEO satellite equipped with the Satellite Based Augmentation (SBAS) function has a transmitter for GNSS correction signals at the L1 and L5 bands which may interfere with the GNSS SSV receiver at the same satellite. This means, due to the expected strong interference, GNSS signals at the L1 and L5 bands cannot be used for the GEO SBAS satellite, and the use of GPS L2C signals can be considered as an alternative. This paper presents the development of GPS L2C signal generator for SSV in GEO simulation. The GPS L2C signal simulation process for GEO satellites and the structure of the GPS L2C signal generator are presented. A verification through the receiver test with a GNSS SDR is included to show the feasibility of the designed signal simulator. The validation is performed by analyzing the PSD, the results of acquisition, code/carrier tracking, and C/N0 estimation.},

By adaptively adjusting the information sharing factor, we can adjust the weight of each local filter. To validate navigation performance, we conducted UGV driving tests in various indoor environments. We conducted experiments by driving a UGV on a course with a diameter of 3.6 meters. UGVs are equipped with LiDAR, MPS receivers, and IMUs to measure data. We used four 1-meter diameter MPS coils. An optical motion capture device, the Optitrack, was used as reference data.},

Simulations for the derived EKF VPLs are conducted under a specific IMU-fault condition and under no-IMU-fault condition to investigate typical performance.

  abstract = {An integrity-based path planning strategy for autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) navigation in urban environments is developed. The vehicle is assumed to navigate by utilizing cellular long-term evolution (LTE) signals in addition to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Given a desired destination, an optimal path is calculated, which minimizes a cost function that considers both the horizontal protection level (HPL) and travel distance. The constraints are that (i) the ratio of nodes with faulty signals to the total nodes be lower than a maximum allowable ratio and (ii) the HPLs along each candidate path be lower than the horizontal alert limit (HAL). To predict the faults and HPL before the vehicle is driven, GPS and LTE pseudoranges along the candidate paths are generated utilizing a commercial ray-tracing software and three-dimensional (3D) terrain and building maps. Simulated pseudoranges inform the path planning algorithm about potential biases due to reflections from buildings in urban environments. Simulation results are presented showing that the optimal path produced by the proposed path planning strategy has the minimum average HPL among the candidate paths.},

  abstract = {We propose fusion of stereo visual odometry and ranging for Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). Two basic processes of feature- and keyframe-based stereo visual odometry (Tracking and Local mapping) are operated in the algorithm, while saving all local keyframes, map points, and visual constraints in a global map database, as well as the available ranging constraints of the keyframes. At the end of the sequence, state estimates by visual odometry are fused with ranging measurements to mitigate the inherent accumulating errors in the process and achieve global consistency. We formulate a simple graphical representation for the fusion, and perform least squares estimation with the sparse Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to minimize the summation of the re-projection and distance squared errors over all the defined constraints in the global graph. The proposed algorithm is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively on a real stereo image dataset with synthetically generated distance measurements with superimposed Gaussian white noise. The experimental results show that the proposed SLAM algorithm effectively compensates the cumulative bias in visual odometry. Furthermore, the global accuracy of the trajectory estimation is comparable to the one of stereo vision-only SLAM with closing loops.},

  abstract = {To support the autonomous mission capability of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), developing a navigation system that ensures precise positioning performance during the final approach phase is necessary. Typically, UASs used in general are guided by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and inertial measurement unit (IMU), fused by loosely coupled form with a Kalman filter, which provides reliable positioning solution to approximately a meter level. However, the meter level of positioning accuracy exceeds the height of most small UASs. Furthermore, accuracy is degraded in GNSS harsh environment owing to signal blockage, multipath, and poor satellite geometry. To overcome such limitations of the loosely coupled GNSS/IMU Kalman filter, this study presents a combination of the tightly coupled GNSS/IMU and ultra-wide band (UWB) measurements obtained from the network setup that is nearby the landing site to ensure safe landing of small UASs. For higher positioning performance of the tightly coupled GNSS/IMU/UWB Kalman filter, we used an experimental air-to-ground error model of UWB ranging characteristics and a Kalman filter with retrodiction to process time-delayed measurements. Then, an outlier detection and rejection based on innovation test is also applied. The positioning accuracy of the proposed method increases as the UAS approaches a touch-down point, which is a desirable positioning characteristic for UAS landing operations. The results based on multiple flight tests showed a 20 cm 3D root mean squared error (RMSE) compared to that of the reference trajectory during the final approach.},

Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) information is valuable and used on a routine basis, however having multiple methods of obtaining navigation information for small UAVs is desirable. One popular method of utilizing vision information for UAV navigation is that of Visual Odometry (VO), even though without additional aides, position drift is unbounded for this approach. This study investigates the amount of additional information that is required to bound the position drift for a UAV that is using a VO algorithm at the heart of its navigation solution. The proposed method is to utilize a pair of ranging radios between a GNSS denied UAV navigating with VO and another UAV that has access to good GNSS information, giving it a known location. A flight test recreating this scenario was performed in July 2017 and the data are used to demonstrate the proposed concept. In addition to test data, an analytic observability analysis is presented.},

However, it is hard to utilize their actual positioning and navigation performance capabilities due to the disparate sensors, software technologies adopted among manufacturers, and the high influence of environmental conditions. In this research, we proposed a framework to seamlessly navigate people from land vehicle in urban area to pedestrian in indoor environment. The scheme for land vehicle navigation is the integration of measurements from inertial measurement unit (IMU), GNSS chipset, and camera through the extended Kalman filter (EKF). In which, visual measurement from camera is pre-processed by ORB-SLAM, re-scaled by the assistance of GNSS measurement, and transformed to velocity before utilized to update the integration filter. For indoor environment, a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR)/ORB-SLAM integrated system is used to navigate pedestrian. In order to verify the performance of proposed framework, the field tests were conducted in the downtown area of Tainan city, Taiwan with land vehicle and indoor environment with pedestrian. Experimental results indicate that the framework performs well in both phases. It demonstrated that the proposed framework makes smartphone capable of seamlessly navigate people in both outdoor and indoor environments.},

  abstract = {To understand the error sources present in inertial sensors, both the white (time-invariant) and correlated noise sources must be properly characterized. To understand both sources, the standard approach (IEEE standards 647-2006, 9522020) is to compute the Allan variance of the noise and then use human-based interpretation of linear trends to estimate the separate noise sources present in an inertial sensor. Recent work has sought to overcome the graphical nature and visualinspection basis of this approach leading to more accurate noise estimates. However, when using noise characterization in a filter, it is important that the noise estimates be not only accurate but also conservative, i.e., that the estimated noise parameters overbound truth. In this paper, we propose a novel method for automatically estimating conservative noise parameters using Allan variance.},

Hence, this work will conduct BDS multipath simulations with a 3D ray-tracing method in Lujiazui area. The BDS features from GEO, MEO, and IGSO satellites will be investigated in terms of code delay, carrier phase, and Doppler shift. The simulation results show Gamma distributions for all orbits in terms of reflection delay, which are inversely proportional to elevation angles. In addition, the positioning results are skewed to densely constructed geometry due to the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals.},

  abstract = {In order to obtain high-precision positioning results in GNSS-challenged environments, Real-time kinematic (RTK) techniques are widely applied because they use double-differenced carrier phase observations to provide accurate ranging information. Traditional RTK techniques always need to resolve the integer number of carrier cycles, which is usually called “integer ambiguity”. The success rate of ambiguity resolution depends on the number of available satellites and the quality of pseudorange measurements. In GNSS-challenged environments, blockage and reflection of obstacles lead to a reduction in the number of available satellites and large multipath noise of pseudorange measurements, so the high-precision nature of RTK techniques cannot be guaranteed. On this account, this paper proposes an ambiguity-free smoothing algorithm for multipath mitigation, which eliminates invariant ambiguities within a sliding window of time. Thus, carrier phase observations are decoupled from the unknown number of relative integer ambiguities and can be directly used in the smoothing algorithm as a correction constraint for the INS kinematic model. This reduces the time spent on ambiguity searching and further speeds up the positioning process by reducing the dimension of the state variable. In order to obtain as many ambiguity-free observations as possible, our algorithm usesThus, our new algorithm uses pre-integrated the idea of pre-integration and specify the selection strategy of reference satellites. After the carrier-phase measurements are pre-processed, the remaining valid constraints will be used to detect and eliminate pseudorange outliers. The results of simulation experiments show that the algorithm of this paper can provide decimeter-level or even centimeter-level accuracy under the condition of large pseudorange multipath.},

DME/DME as the main reversionary method provides Alternative Positioning, Navigation and Timing (A-PNT) services for use during a GNSS outage. When there is only one pair of DMEs used to aircraft location detection, the distribution of these 2 stations has strict requirements. Considering the geometry limitation of DME/DME, multi-DME with better geometry can be used to increase the accuracy and integrity of positioning. In this paper, we further proposed the integrity monitoring method for A-PNT using barometric measurements aided multi-DMEs. The combination of the barometric altimeter and multi-DME system can make full use of the altitude value provided by the barometer altimeter to improve the geometric performance of the DME stations and the availability of the autonomous integrity monitoring. The test results demonstrate that RNP 1 can be achieved by both methods for most part of Europe, and the using barometric measurements aided multi-DMEs method improves the performance of the autonomous integrity monitoring on both fault detection capability and protection level.},

Existing localization algorithms assume the sound speed is constant and the propagation path is a straight line. However, sound speed varies with temperature, pressure, and salinity, causing the bend of underwater sound propagation. Therefore, even if perfect underwater time synchronization exists and TOA or TDoA measurements can be obtained, the localization performance is still degraded by the wrong assumption model.},

  abstract = {Animal-mounted GPS-based location tracking has become a core tool for wildlife ecologists. However, the lifetimes of animalmounted devices (or “tags”) are typically limited by battery life, and GPS tracking occupies a large portion of their energy budgets. In this paper, we propose and test several Kalman filter-based algorithms that reduce the GPS duty cycle while still maintaining a threshold of tracking accuracy. These algorithms leverage low-power accelerometry measurements to estimate the uncertainty in the tag’s location, then schedule GPS measurements to suppress that uncertainty. We show that these strategies can reduce average GPS uptime, though at the cost of fidelity in some cases.},

  abstract = {To increase the survivals of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals in weak and jammed environments, a technique called time division data multiplexing has been utilized in modernized GNSS signals. Different from conventional techniques, it modulates odd chips but not even chips, and makes conventional long PN-code acquisition methods based on frequency-domain correlation technique cannot be directly applied. To the end, a crosswise reconstructing and folding based acquisition method is proposed in the paper. By rearranging local code replicas and absorbing the advantages of previously proposed folding technique, the method not only is capable of preventing possible energy cancellation of odd and even chips and makes frequency-domain correlation technique applicable to TDDM signals acquisition, but also accelerates the search speed of testing code phases. Simulation results show the validity of the method.},

Particularly, we aim at substituting standard correlation schemes (that are optimal under nominal conditions) with Neutral Network (NN)-based correlation schemes, that are able to learn multipath channels, otherwise challenging to be captured by physics-based models. The solution involves the use of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) structure, which exploits the optimality of standard correlation schemes at the same time that adjusts its behavior to better model multipath. The proposed solution can be used in substitution of standard correlation, then seamlessly plugged on acquisition and tracking receiver blocks.

  abstract = {Due to its high accuracy and Earth coverage, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) has been achieving an ever increasing penetration in our daily life. However, GNSS performance can be easily degraded by Radio Frequency (RF) interference, which can be easily encountered in real world situations. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt mitigation strategies able to reduce the impact of interference. Several interference mitigation strategies are based on the Interference Cancellation (IC) principle, which requires the detection and estimation of the interference waveform. The Robust Interference Mitigation (RIM) framework is an alternative to this type of approaches and mitigates interference using robust statistics principles treating interference as outliers. Most interference signals can be represented as outliers in certain domain and robust methods are typically efficient ways to remove them. For instance, Huber’s non-linearity, which is a typical robust approach, has been studied for its application in either time or transformed (e.g., frequency) domains with promising results. In real world applications, it is however difficult to know a priori whether the interference can be treated as an outlier in the time or transformed domains. Therefore, this work investigates the application of Huber’s non-linearity in both domains. This approach is termed as Dual-Domain RIM (DD-RIM) and provides enhanced performance compared to single domain approaches.},

  abstract = {Due to the open signal structure and low power of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) civil signals, GNSS receivers are vulnerable to spoofing attacks that will make the victim receiver get the wrong position, velocity, and time (PVT) results. Many anti-spoofing methods are proposed but mainly focus on spoofing detection. It is relatively difficult to identify and exclude all spoofing signals, but also more meaningful for getting the precise positioning results. In the paper, we propose a spoofing exclusion method based on density clustering by using the known rough user position. The rough position is relatively easy to get, such as through cellular network, inertial measurement unit (IMU), Loran-C, etc. We detect spoofing by comparing the difference between the rough position and the positioning result of the victim receiver. If spoofing signals exist, pseudorange-distance biases are computed by the rough position, the satellite positions, and the measured pseudoranges. Further, the density clustering algorithm for pseudorange-distance biases is used to exclude spoofing signals and recover the precise positioning results of the receiver. The detailed analyses of the factors affecting spoofing exclusion are carried out, and the relevant experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {For high-precision positioning applications in large-scale urban environment, since the performance of traditional stand-alone GNSS-based RTK degrades greatly due to the signal blockage and multipath effect, multi-sensor integration systems become the most popular solutions most of which require to build LiDAR maps before positioning. However, not all the applications are suited to this scheme. For the applications that cannot build prior maps, if only odometry-based sensors are used, the issue of accumulative error will arise in large-scale area. Therefore, we still hope to use RTK in multi-sensor integration to maintain the global accuracies of positioning, as well as mapping, and as a matter of course, the aim of this paper is to improve RTK performance in complicated environments by sensor integration. With this purpose, we propose a feature-based RTK/LiDAR/INS integrated system which is designed to utilize the measurements of the repeatedly observed LiDAR features to support RTK, specifically, to improve RTK fix rate. In detail, we adopt tight coupling scheme, after initializing the LiDAR feature map with RTK, we can introduce the measurements of the LiDAR feature with previously obtained global parameters to RTK to estimate a more accurate search center for ambiguities in GNSS-challenged environments, and thus, to improve the success rate of RTK ambiguity resolution. Then, the RTK result derived at each epoch can be used to update the global parameters of the new features, which forms a mode of positioning while mapping. Both theoretical analyses and simulation experiment results prove that integrating with LiDAR feature measurements can improve the performance of RTK in urban environments.},

  abstract = {With the popularity of researches in self-driving and advanced control systems, high-precision positioning techniques in urban environments have attracted more and more attention. The buildings and trees always cause signal reflections and blockages, which lead to multipath phenomenon in GNSS receptions and a reduction in the number of available satellites. In such a challenging environment, the conventional Real-time kinematic (RTK) techniques cannot provide precise positioning results independently, since the integer ambiguity resolution as its critical step is relevant to the observation quality of satellite signals. Thus, in this paper we propose an improved ambiguity resolution algorithm for INS/RTK integration, which search integer solution in the position domain using particle filter. Our integrated INS/RTK algorithm aims at enhancing the availability of integrated navigation systems and maintaining accuracy in harsh environments. Here the INS is integrated to predict motion between adjacent epochs and to generate a set of particles as searching region. In this case, inertial aiding can help reduce search space volume by providing a more accurate position and error covariance matrix. Moreover, double-differenced GPS and BDS measurements are used to update the posterior probability to determine the final integer solution. By constructing an appropriate observation model, the calculation of the posterior probability only involves the fractional part of current carrier-phase observations, so the new algorithm is insensitive to the quality of pseudorange and cycle slips. The improved ambiguity resolution algorithm is demonstrated on both simulated and real-world datasets. Compared with other RTK algorithms which search integer solutions in the ambiguity domain, our improved algorithm shows better accuracy and stability, especially when the satellite visibility changes frequently or the pseudorange noise is large.},

Considering the local characteristics of ionosphere over China and its surrounding area, a new approach for precisely modeling the ionospheric delay is developed for BDS WAAS. In this approach, the ionospheric delay is considered as the sum of the trend and stochastic terms. The trend term is represented by an adjusted spherical harmonic (ASH) function, and the stochastic term is described by a timevariant covariance function. The ASH-based ionospheric model and the covariance function are simultaneously estimated using real data in order to capture the subtle variations in local ionospheric delay.},

  abstract = {Autonomous driving is playing more and more an important role, not only in automobile but also in maritime applications. Accurate and robust localization of the local system and the participants nearby is one of the key aspects in applying autonomous surface vehicles. The presented publication is part of the developments of the joint project GALILEOnautic 2, which develops a system for autonomous, cooperative maneuvering of networked vessels in harbors and safety critical areas. In this context, the paper on hand proposes a novel cooperative navigation strategy of a connected autonomous vessels system, which ensures an accurate and robust localization of the networked participants and detects the marine environment as basis of autonomous driving in the maritime field. Using environmental sensors, such as light detecting and ranging (LIDAR) and radio detection and ranging (radar), the objects nearby can be detected and clustered. These detections are then associated with the participants information accessed via network communication. Using the methods, such as similarity comparison and modified Dempster-Schaefer theory, the detections from different resources can be aligned with each other, and the environmental detections can then be classified in different categories. Subsequently, the information from networked participants who possess an accurate geodetic position can be used to enhance the robustness and accuracy of the own local positioning by combining relative distance and relative angle between the own vehicle and a networked participant with a known geodetic position. At this point, an extended Kalman filter is implemented: the information of the neighbor participants, e.g. distance and angle to other objects along with local GNSS information, and velocity measurements, are used to update the EKF states. Before a future maritime test, the proposal is validated through a smaller scenario with three experimental vehicles. A possible networked scenario with networked participants and obstacles is conducted. The results showed, that the proposed implementation can successfully detect, identify, and categorize the objects in the environment. Aided with the cooperative information, the navigation filter can achieve a robust positioning with an accuracy of under one meter, even in the case of an unavailability of GNSS measurements.},

  abstract = {This publication presents the implementations of a tightly-coupled navigation filter on an embedded GNSS receiver, especially designed for railway applications. The tightly-coupled navigation filter processes the measurements of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and signals of a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Different methods to correct the pseudo-ranges of the satellite measurements have been implemented, such as the use of two frequencies for each satellite (dual-frequency), differentially corrected GPS (DGPS) and Klobuchar, [1], [2]. To select the most suitable correction mode with respect to current reception conditions, the navigation filter is extended by a state machine. Furthermore, the implementation of the navigation filter on an embedded system is presented. The used hardware and implemented software architecture are introduced. The synchronization of different sensors is achieved via a Pulse per Second (PPS) signal using the GNSS time. In order to implement the navigation filter, which is a combination of event-triggered signal preprocessing and time-based multirate extended Kalman filter, in a single-core processor with limited calculation capacity, a multi-threading framework has been proposed. The performance of the navigation filter in the embedded GNSS receiver is validated in two real world scenarios: rail track between two railway stations in Bayern, Germany, and a shunting railway station in Wustermark, Germany. Different conditions are encountered and the corresponding results are analyzed. In the rail track scenario with harsh environmental conditions such as wooded surroundings, signal damping due to heavy snow and multi-path effects due to snow covered ground and trees are encountered. A 2D accuracy of approximately 2-4 meter was achieved based on multi-constellation with the dual-frequency correction method. On the other hand, the shunting scenario was characterized by an adequate satellite reception and mobile radio, which was used to receive DGPS correction data. Under these conditions, an average 2D accuracy with less than 0.4 meter has been achieved, which has guaranteed a track-accurate localization as basis for autonomous shunting within the joint-research project Galileo Online: GO!.},

  abstract = {A ground based augmentation system (GBAS) is a system proposed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to meet the stringent navigation requirements of civil aviation. We have already developed a GBAS prototype, so this time, we installed the experimental reference receivers near Taichung International Airport (ICAO code: RCMQ) in Taiwan. Then, we conducted flight tests at the airport and evaluated the navigation performance of the GBAS prototype. The experiment was conducted to validate the GBAS performance under GBAS approach service type (GAST) C specifications. Before the flight tests, we conducted a field test at Kaohsiung International Airport (ICAO code: RCKH). We installed reference stations and a static ground user near the runway at RCKH. The field test data was used to validate the performance of the GBAS prototype under the required navigation performance (RNP) of a Category (CAT) I precision approach and landing. The result showed no hazardously misleading information (HMI) in the finite data we received. In this paper, we evaluate the GBAS prototype with the flight test data. There were three flight tests in the experiments. The first flight test was carried out on October 24, 2019. Each flight test took approximately three hours. We focus our analyses on the approach phase since the GBAS is aimed toward supporting precision approaches and landing. The results of this validation showed that an HMI event occurred, and the performance of the GBAS prototype appeared to fail to meet the CAT I requirement based on the flight test data. We speculated that the HMI was due to either multipath or noise. A detailed analysis of the resulting navigation capabilities is carried out in this paper.},

  abstract = {Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning with tilt compensation breaks the conventional positioning pattern with level-free and tilted surveys. The inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based solution uses mainstream tilted RTK principles, but it is disturbed by inertial navigation system (INS) alignment and degraded performance with increasing tilt angle. This solution has been applied to the GNSS receivers of some companies. However, there are few relevant literature reports, and technical details are not available. In this paper, we propose a low-cost and efficient IMU-based tilted RTK solution with relevant algorithms, including a rapid and accurate heading alignment method and zero velocity update (ZUPT) with lever arm compensation. The proposed heading alignment method calculates the initial heading from the angle between INS-indicated and RTK-indicated trajectories. An INS updating algorithm distinguished from conventional one is used to obtain INS-indicated trajectories by treating the pole movement as rigid body motion and discarding accelerometer measurement. ZUPT with lever arm compensation doesn’t require the pole to keep completely still. This ZUPT works when the pole tip touchs the ground. By validating the zero velocity of the pole tip, we can constrain the position error divergence and reduce the defects of the tilt angle. Then, accuracy analysis is performed, and explicit error equations are obtained. Experiments are carried out to validate the proposed solution, and the statistical results indicate that 1) the initial heading can be accurately determined to be 1.15◦ at a 98.2\% confidence level within 2∼3 seconds; 2) taking the ratio of horizontal error within 2 cm as a criterion, ZUPT with lever arm compensation can raise this ratio effectively even at a large tilt angle; 3) the horizontal position error of the proposed tilted RTK solution is within 2 cm at a 96.97\% confidence level at a normal tilt angle.},

  abstract = {This dissertation work deals with parameter estimation and data association for tracking multiple targets. In parameter estimation part, first we consider the problem of finding an aircraft's trajectory, speed and altitude in three dimensional (3-D) space using range and azimuth (bearing) measurements from a two dimensional (2-D) radar that does not measure elevation. A Probabilistic Data Association based Maximum Likelihood (ML-PDA) estimator is proposed for estimating the target motion parameters in the presence of false measurements and missed detections. The estimation accuracies are quantified using the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for different sensor-target configurations. Of particular interest is the achievable accuracy for estimating the target altitude, which can be only inferred from the 2-D observations. Then we consider another estimation problem of identifying the parameters of a proportional navigation guidance missile (pursuer) pursuing an airborne target (evader) using angle-only measurements from the latter. The purpose is for the evader to take appropriate countermeasures in a timely manner. The time-to-go estimate can also be obtained from the proposed parameter estimate. In the data association part, first we present a new assignment-based algorithm for data association in tracking ground targets employing evasive move-stop-move maneuvers, using Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) reports. We develop a novel “two-dummy” assignment approach that can distinguish the non-detection event due to PD {$<$} 1 and the non-detection event due to a target's stop. Using this new algorithm, we can obtain reductions in both RMS estimation errors as well as the total number of track breakages. Finally, a data association (DA) method using assignment, combined with the probability hypothesis density (PHD) approach based on particle filtering implementation is proposed for multitarget tracking. The combined algorithm, consisting data association and PHD filter is illustrated using the result of the PHD filter to get the estimated number and locations of the targets for data association and using the result of data association for PHD peak extraction. A novel PHD representation defined in a resolution cell (PHDRC), is also presented. It is shown that the final proposed algorithm, DA-PHDRC, shows better performance than the PHDRC filter and the traditional MHT/assignment algorithms.},

  abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning quality, continuity and reliability can be severely impaired by ionospheric propagation, in particular during strong space weather events. Ionospheric amplitude and phase scintillation cause power fading and random phase fluctuations of the received signal, leading to a reduced performance of the receiver tracking loops. This can translate into significant errors in the final position solution, especially when higher accuracy is concerned. In the period between 4 and 10 September 2017, several space weather events, including two coronal mass ejections, triggered disturbed conditions of the near-Earth space. This interval was considered one of the most flare-productive of now-waning solar cycle. Significant disturbances on GPS L1 signals have been observed and automatically recorded by a network of GNSS monitoring stations based on customized Software Defined Radio data grabbers and receivers. Relevant and highly unique raw samples are being processed to deeply investigate the phenomenon. The analysis of the data collected in different stations, in terms of scintillation indices time-series, shows a connection between the recording in the different locations of the world. In addition, the impact of such a strong event in receiver has been analyzed, focusing on positioning algorithms employing phase measurements to smooth code measurements. Results show a good correlation between the values of the scintillation indices and the positioning error, showing that carrier-smoothing techniques are particularly sensitive to distortion induced by phase scintillation. Such an impact is automatically observed by means of the identification of clusters in the positioning solutions through a machine learning algorithm. The adoption of carrier smoothing hence reveals weaknesses in precise positioning during scintillations events. At the same time, a novel scintillation detection technique based on clustering of the position solution is suggested.},

In terms of integration strategies, the ultra-tight or deep integration, has gained increasingly more popularities over the conventional loose or tight integrations.

  abstract = {The release of raw multi-GNSS data from Android smart devices opens up the opportunity of democratizing high-precision GNSS using super low-cost chipsets. We developed a method to integrate Android GNSS with accelerometer data to capture broadband vibration displacements at sub-centimeter resolution, which was firstly premised on the high-precision temporal synchronization among diverse Android sensors. Therefore, with the GPS/Galileo L1/L5 data collected with a low-profile patch antenna wired to a Xiaomi 8 smartphone, we time tagged the accelerometer data by calibrating a time shift between the two sorts of data. Despite this initial temporal alignment, the instability of the smartphone clock, as well as the sampling inconsistency between the accelerometer and the GNSS chipset, would still cause further synchronization errors, which were then estimated along with the displacement in the data fusion process. In this case, we presented that the accelerometer data could be synchronized with the GPS time at an accuracy of less than 10 ms, though no pulse-per-second signal from the GNSS chipset can be accessed by the smartphone accelerometers. Based on this achievement, a shake table test further showed that the displacements of the integrated Xiaomi 8 GNSS/accelerometer solution achieved an accuracy of 0.3 cm, which was a 42\% improvement over that of the Android system time-based method, and their frequency bandwidth was increased from 0.5 Hz to 50 Hz. Moreover, an airgun active source experiment in a Yunnan earthquake-prone region verified this GNSS/accelerometer integration rooted in Android smartphones in monitoring micro-vibrations of larger than 2 cm/s2; encouragingly, the timing error of vibration recordings was less than 0.7 ms. We therefore demonstrate that Android multi-GNSS data can be synchronized and integrated effectively with smartphone accelerometers to resolve sub-centimeter vibrations, which will boost the application of super low-cost sensors in earthquake and structure monitoring.},

In this contribution, we investigate the triple-frequency PPP AR with B1, B2 and B3 observations from BDS-2 satellites and evaluate the performance of the triple-frequency PPP AR with mixed BDS-2 and BDS-3 satellites. The uncalibrated phase delay (UPD) products are estimated based on triple-frequency observations of BDS-2 and BDS-3 satellites and the quality of UPD products in terms of temporal stability and residual distributions are evaluated. Data recorded from 9 International GNSS Monitoring and Assessment System (iGMAS) stations, 17 Crustal Movement Observation Network of China (CMONOC) stations and 83 Multi-GNSS Experiment (MGEX) stations for a 60-day period were used to validate the effectiveness of BDS UPD products and triple-frequency PPP AR method. Our results show that the wide-lane (WL) and narrow-lane (NL) UPDs with a standard deviation (STD) of less than 0.1 cycles can be achieved for BDS-2 satellites after the code bias correction while a STD within 0.1 cycles can also be achieved for BDS-3 satellites. With the precise UPD products, the triple-frequency BDS PPP AR with BDS-2 and BDS-3 observations can be implemented. Numerous results showed that the performance in terms of positioning accuracy and convergence time can be obviously improved by ambiguity resolution. The triple-frequency PPP AR achieved the best performance with the time to first fix (TTFF) of 30.95 min, a 11.6\% improvement compared to dual-frequency fixed solution and 18.5\% improvement compared to triple-frequency float solution. With respect to the triple-frequency float solution, the positioning accuracy is improved by 32.23\%, 17.04\% and 13.70\% by PPP ambiguity resolution.},

  abstract = {Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) real-time kinematic (RTK) has shown centimeter-level absolute positioning results in open-sky areas. However, it is also known to suffer from polluted GNSS measurements and poor satellite geometry in urban canyons, because of the non-line-of-sight and multipath reception caused by the signal blockage and reflection. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors, along with LiDAR/inertial measurement unit (IMU) odometry systems, can provide precise environment description and short-term accurate relative positioning capability, which could be utilized for aiding GNSS-RTK to obtain better performance. The recently developed 3D LiDAR-aided GNSS-RTK positioning methods detected the GNSS NLOS receptions via the incrementally built map and improve the satellite geometry using the low-lying virtual satellite from LiDAR features. However, the high-elevation angle NLOS receptions can not be fully detected and the multipath signals cannot be effectively mitigated. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a 3D LiDAR aided GNSS-RTK positioning method via iterated coarse to fine batch optimization by (1) Global 3D point cloud map aided NLOS exclusion which enables the detection of highelevation angle NLOS receptions. (2) Iterated batch optimization based on a innovatively devised tightly-coupled factor graph which fully exploits the global consistency among the constraints of LiDAR, IMU and GNSS-RTK to exclude the potential multipath signals. Our proposed method aims to achieve lifelong accurate positioning performance in deeply urbanized areas. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been proved by the evaluation conducted on our open-source challenging dataset, UrbanNav, which contains various sequences collected by automobile-level low-cost GNSS receivers in urban canyons of Hong Kong.},

Strong scintillation can severely impact signal acquisition and tracking in a GNSS receiver, resulting in a performance degradation in accuracy and continuity. Therefore, a thorough understanding of ionospheric scintillation effects on GNSS signals has drawn much attention in both the scientific fields and industry. Previously, the scintillation events were manually identified by human experts, which hampers the possibility of conducting a large batch processing. In this paper, we first implement an improved machine learning algorithm to automatically detect scintillation events. We also show that the improved version outperforms the previous implementation. Then we apply the trained machine learning algorithms to a large database of GPS L1C/A data collected in equatorial and high latitude areas to detect amplitude scintillation. Finally, the statistical characterization of the detected amplitude scintillation is presented and discussed.},

A major challenge is to differentiate an oscillator anomaly from ionospheric scintillation. Although both scintillation and oscillator anomalies cause phase disturbances, their underlying physics are different and, therefore, show different carrier frequency dependency. By using triple-frequency signals, distinct features are extracted from the disturbed signals and applied to the radial basis function (RBF) support vector machine (SVM) classifier to identify an oscillator anomaly. The results show that the proposed RBF SVM displays superior performance and outperforms several other classification methods. The proposed approach is applied on a database to conduct automatic satellite oscillator anomaly detection. Preliminary detection results show that there are on average 1.7 and 0.2 anomaly events observed on PRN1 and PRN25 each day, respectively.},

This project first characterizes the effects of known GNSS interference events on ADS-B outputs. We then utilize these observed behaviors to identify suspected interference events at other locations. This paper performs this analysis using publicly available records of ADS-B transmissions. The events that we sought to identify were based on pilot reports of interrupted GNSS service to aircraft on approach to a San Francisco bay area airport. Approach procedures may be more likely to encounter interference due to the closer proximity to the ground and therefore to potential radiofrequency interference (RFI) sources. Further, these procedures have the most stringent safety requirements.},

To deal with this problem, we propose a computationally efficient ultra-tight integration of GNSS and INS in this paper. Compared to the traditional ultra-tight integration, the GNSS signal tracking in the presented integration scheme is non-consecutive. The GNSS signal code phase of each used satellite is predicted according to the INS solution, and the code phase error obtained by a non-coherent code discriminator is directly applied as the measurement of the integration filter to estimate and correct INS solution error. The GNSS signal tracking interval can be adaptively adjusted according to the real-time GNSS code tracking error. To validate the presented scheme, a vehicle-based experiment based on a software defined receiver is performed, in which GPS L1 C/A and Galileo E1 signals are non-consecutively tracked and ultra-tightly coupled with MEMS based INS. The experiment results show that the presented integration is able to maintain the lock of GNSS code signal and can significantly reduce system’s computational burden with a little loss of navigation accuracy.},

  abstract = {Satellite-based positioning using both the global and local GNSS signals is becoming a very attractive technique to provide desirable localization precision and services to Cooperative Intelligent Transportation System (C-ITS). Integrity monitoring has been concerned in many C-ITS applications, especially some specified safety-critical services and applications. However, conventional Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) methods would be constrained under challenged observing environment. Specific observations from DSRC (Dedicated Short Range Communication) using IEEE 802.11p protocols, like the range-rates between cooperative vehicles, make it possible of enhancing the measurements from the GNSS receiver and enabling integrity monitoring even under constrained GNSS satellite observing conditions. This paper aims at enhancing conventional RAIM method using DSRC range-rate measurement and grid-based local GNSS observation quality models. A virtual pseudo-range establishment strategy for the practically invisible satellites is proposed by using DSRC CFO (Carrier Frequency Offset) data and the road map database. A dynamic measurement weighting method for FDE (Fault Detection and Exclusion) is presented with grid-based local observation quality models derived by curve fitting techniques. The proposed RAIM solution is tested with field data and simulations. Raw data collection in a local campus area is utilized to establish the practical local GNSS observation quality models. Simulations are carried out with specific software tools to generate GNSS and DSRC observations coordinately for RAIM according to the proposed solution under different limited GNSS observation conditions. The results illustrate that the DSRC-enhanced RAIM solution using grid-based local GNSS observation quality models is capable of achieving the high available and effective fault detection, identification and exclusion even with limited GNSS measurements, which is significant for trustworthy positioning in many next generation C-ITS applications.},

Using the innovation, a detection scheme has been developed to determine whether a maneuver is indeed occurring. If the target is under manoeuvre, we consider the impact of manoeuvre in target states as a changed bounded noise term in state transition equation. The ellipsoidal set based filter estimation defines an ellipsoidal set in position and velocity space which must contain the true target state. The ellipsoidal set based filter has been compared to the extended Kalman filter and extended optimal bounding ellipsoid, and the simulation results show that the ellipsoidal set based filter is successful in accommodating unknown maneuver models and unknown but bounded noise for maneuvering target tracking problems.},

We then partition the data for different observable conditions and examine the differences among the bounding parameters to determine whether the current bounding behavior is representative of future data. Our study shows that the means of the Gaussian bounding are small, most of the standard deviations are below the user range accuracy, and the near-fault data points affect the stability of the bounding parameters for different observable conditions.},

However, before GNSS attitude determination can be achieved, the carrier-phase integer ambiguity must be resolved. We handle the attitude determination problem by arranging the GNSS receiving antennas on two non-collinear baselines, which allow us to obtain the 3-D attitude of the moving platform on which they are stationed. Initially, we tackle the ambiguity resolution problem independently over each baseline based on single phase-difference measurements. To this end, we discuss and test two different approaches to carrier-phase ambiguity resolution. We either exploit the receiver antenna configuration or employ multiple carrier frequencies. Namely, we show that for special configurations of collinear antenna triplets, the ambiguity resolution problem can be handled using a simple algebraic formula. A similar approach is developed for a baseline with only two antennas in which we utilize a pair of GNSS carrier frequencies that satisfy a specific condition.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) attitude determination method based on Riemannian manifold optimization techniques. By noting that the solution set of the attitude determination problem is a Riemannian manifold, we formulate the problem as an optimization on the Riemannian manifold. We study the manifold geometry to design an efficient attitude determination algorithm. As a first step, we calculate a float solution using Riemannian manifold optimization to be used as the starting point for the integer search process. Since this solution makes full use of the geometrical constraints, it is expected to have an improvement over the popular least-squares estimator. To utilize the improved float solution, we propose a new decomposition of the objective function, which allows us to apply Riemannian optimization to the process of integer ambiguity resolution. Numerical simulations and actual experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for various system configurations.},

Current solutions for interference detection and localization (IDL) such as using radio direction finding are generally costly and time-consuming. The approach described in this paper uses Automatic Dependent Surveillance—Broadcast (ADS-B) reports for IDL and applies machine learning algorithms to this data. We utilized a standard neural network (NN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect GNSS interference event in a given airspace. These models take airplane's ADS-B reports as inputs and output a classification of whether this airplane has experienced jamming. With this approach, we achieved 83.6\% and 90.4\% accuracy for corresponding model. We used logistic regression as a baseline model which achieved an 75.1\% accuracy.},

Carrier phase power spectral density and carrier phase ratios between carriers are extracted from measurements and applied as input features to the random forest algorithm. The method is trained using data collected at 7 GNSS monitoring stations located at Alaska, Ascension Island, Greenland, Hong Kong, Peru, Puerto Rico, and Singapore. The overall detection accuracies of 98.4\% and 99.0\% are achieved for dual- and triple-frequency signals, respectively. The method outperforms other machine learning algorithms.

  abstract = {This paper describes a land-based navigation system that integrates inertial sensors and odometer with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). In the proposed multisensor navigation system, the popular point-based scan matching algorithm Iterative Closest Point (ICP) is used to estimate the vehicle’s relative translational and rotational changes from raw LiDAR measurements without the need for feature extraction. To accelerate the ICP algorithm and improve the accuracy, the outputs of Inertial Navigation System (INS) and odometry are used as an initial motion guess to enhance the scan matching algorithm by reducing the error in initial alignment. The relative translation and rotation changes from LiDAR are fused with changes from INS/Odometry through Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in a tightly coupled scheme. Real experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. Results showed that by integrating LiDAR with INS/Odometry, inertial sensors biases are accurately estimated and the error accumulation in navigation solutions derived from INS/Odometry can be significantly reduced. Meanwhile, with inertial aiding, the accuracy and the convergence time of LiDAR scan matching can be improved as well. Finally, a map of the operating environment is generated based on the corrected pose of the vehicle.},

  abstract = {With the purpose of improving the robustness of the interference mitigation, methods using tensor operations are explored in this paper. Specifically, a three-order tensor-based signal model is constructed to cater to the three-dimensional characteristics of the signals received by the electromagnetic (EM) vector-sensor array. The polarized diversity of the signals is considered, in addition to the temporal and spatial information. Furthermore, canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) of tensors in the presence of noise is explored to decompose the tensor-based signal model. The three factor matrices of the tensor can be obtained by CPD, wherein the second factor matrix is the steering vector matrix of the interference signals. The direction of arrival (DoA) of the interference signals can be extracted from the second factor matrix by algebraic methods. Additionally, the second factor matrix can also be used to suppress the interference. In a highly dynamic environment, considering that the degradation of anti-interference performance caused by the presence of the random steering vector mismatches, we propose a robust interference mitigation method. Hereinto, the key innovative steps of the proposed method is that with the presence of mismatch conditions, we derive the decomposition process of the tensor-based signal model to obtain the factor matrices, and calculate the projection matrix of the second factor matrix for interference mitigation. Whereafter, an intermediate matrix construction approach is proposed to widen the notch of the DoA of the interference, thereby improving the robustness of interference mitigation. The proposed method requires a smaller number of snapshots to achieve a high level of performance, and avoid the solution process of the covariance matrix which is indispensable to the traditional method.},

  abstract = {In fingerprint positioning, in addition to the higher positioning accuracy of high-dimensional signal feature (SF) fingerprints, there is a problem of large amount of calculation in the positioning process. Aim at the problem above, we define a parameter to evaluate the contribution of access points to positioning: Gradient Dilution of Precision(GrDOP), and we proposed a novel offline dimension-reduce algorithm based on GrDOP and Geometric Constraints. Experiments have shown that several positions on the map that are far away from each other are likely to have extremely similar signal characteristics. This common phenomenon will lead to large fluctuations in positioning results during the online phase. Aiming at issue above, we proposed a GrDOP Geometric Constraints Weighted k-nearest neighbors(GrDOP-GC-WKNN) online matching algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, the method of dual adaptive clustering is used to classify reference points (RP) in signal space and geometric space, calculate the GrDOP in every clusters and reduce dimension according to GrDOP; In the GrDOP-GC-WKNN online positioning algorithm, the positioning result of the previous state is used to position the current state positioning result to reduce the positioning error. An experiment was carried out at the second floor of the fourth building in Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. The positioning accuracy of the algorithm reached 1.22 meters in 80\% of cases and real-time increased 2400\% compared with the traditional fingerprint positioning. The algorithm we proposed provides a theoretical method for indoor high-precision real-time positioning, provide an accurate indoor solution to assist GNSS for accurate seamless positioning.},

PDS has at its core two parts. First, a regression problem with motion model constraints, which equalizes the noise of all locations considering the motion model of the device. Second, a Gaussian process, that analyzes statistical properties of location data to construct uncertainty. Then, a likelihood function, that fuses the two parts, as a basis for a Neyman-Pearson lemma (NPL)-based detection strategy.

Ground-based GNSS jammer detection can be used to detect local interference sources. However, this approach is limited by line of sight (LOS) and hence applying it to large areas is costly in both time and money. A complementary technique is to use airborne GNSS receiver data as provided by Automatic Dependent Surveillance—Broadcast (ADS-B). As these receivers are at altitude, their LOSs can cover a wide ground area. The drawback to this method is that ADS-B was not designed for this purpose and the messages contain limited information for the assessment of radio frequency interference (RFI). This paper develops and demonstrates an algorithm for real-time detection and localization of GNSS interference sources using ADS-B. We implement and demonstrate this capability using recorded ADS-B transmissions from known interference events.},

Subsequently, the underlying causes of continuous loss of cycles in duty cycle mode are described in detail. The following part proposes a carrier reconstruction algorithm based on Doppler resampling and gives several evaluation criteria for reconstruction performance. The experimental results show that the reconstructed carrier measurements improve the accuracy of both the estimations of integer ambiguities and the static solutions, avoiding the error accumulation caused by the raw carrier phase observations.

  abstract = {Robust GNSS interference and spoof detection is a desirable feature to have in many receivers, particularly those used for safety or economically critical activities. Using the combination of automatic gain control (AGC) and carrier to noise ratio (C/No) measurements, collectively termed receiver power monitoring (RPM) is attractive as these metrics are both generally readily available and complimentary. However, detection tests need to be developed that can robustly utilize these measurements to provide detection of spoofing. This paper details the development of our RPM detection method. This method uses snapshot measurement of changes in RPM measures from nominal to identify spoofing from jamming and nominal conditions. A detection threshold line in the 2-D space of ΔAGC and ΔC/No is found to differentiate the cases. The paper discusses the challenges to using these measurements. It shows that the nominal value and variations in this metric is affected by many factors such as aircraft state (i.e. take-off, climb, in flight and approach). The paper outlines the specific steps to calculate the threshold line from empirical data. It shows a metric to quantify the strength of the detection in terms of distance from the threshold line. This provides a single quantitative detection output that allows the technique to integrate with other detection techniques. The threshold calculation is modified to develop a more practical threshold detection that incorporates uncertainty and known relationships between the RPM metrics. One practical improvement is that the technique may not need as much empirical data.},

The Kalman filter innovations are computed by the arctangent phase discriminator, and the state estimates are directly employed in the carrier replica generation. The nonlinear RBF provide more flexibility to capture nonlinear dynamics evolving with time, possibly present in the scintillation phase and amplitude. The weights of the RBF network and the covariance matrices of the process and measurement noise of the Kalman filter are estimated online, in the adaptive Kalman PLL structure. Simulations with synthetic severe scintillation data show the capability of the proposed Kalman PLL to improve robustness to scintillation effects in carrier synchronization, with performance similar to the corresponding structure employing autoregressive (AR) scintillation model. Simulations with real scintillation data collected by a commercial receiver highlight the learning and generalization capability of the RBF networks to cope with evolving scintillation characteristics over time with possibly nonlinear effects. The Kalman PLL structure employing the RBF network presents reduced state estimation errors when compared to the structure employing the AR model.},

Rather, we should rely on many different detection means to provide robust detection. One measurement useful for detection is direction of arrival (DOA), which we can get from many sources such as array and dual polarization antenna (DPA). Even with accurate DOA measurements, good monitor tests are needed to make an accurate decision or determination of spoofing.},

  abstract = {Large natural hazards have been shown to induce traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) caused by the acoustic, acousticgravity, and gravity waves produced from these events. These induced TIDs are observable in the total electron content (TEC) measures from dual-frequency GNSS receivers. Previous research has focused on methods to detect an event on a specific day. This research expands this objective to detect an event from an entire year of slant TEC (sTEC) data. There are several challenges of detecting a natural hazard induced TID across an entire year due to variations of day-to-day and seasonal ionospheric activity, and scintillation due to unknown sources. This work proposes the application of a deep learning neural network, specifically a long short term memory (LSTM) neural network, combined with statistical analysis, to detect TIDs from detrended sTEC (dTEC) for the year 2021 from stations along the Alaskan peninsula and islands. The LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that outputs future dTEC predictions from past dTEC values. TID detections rely on errors calculated as the difference between ground truth observations and the LSTM predictions. These errors are filtered using a rolling mean error threshold to remove moderate to minor errors, as large errors indicate a significant and sudden change in the dTEC data as expected at the start of a TID induced by a significant natural hazard. Station dTEC on dates with large errors detected are then checked for moderate to strong cross-correlation with other stations. Date and times that show an overlap between a pair of stations with large errors and moderate to high correlation at the time of the error (i.e., show phase synchrony) are determined to be an ionospheric anomaly and potential TID. This research work serves as a new method of TID detection for the broader fields of natural hazard detection and ionospheric monitoring.},

  abstract = {The multipath effect can severely reduce the positioning accuracy of GNSS receivers. Thus, it is very important to estimate and mitigate the multipath delay error in tracking algorithms, especially in harsh environments. The code phase error is highly related to the positioning performance. Especially, the absolute position results are dependent on the absolute term of the code phase. However, the absolute code phase is seldom discussed and processed in state-of-the-art methods. In this paper, the absolute position is proposed to form a code phase discriminator to estimate the missing absolute code phase. In this discriminator, the standard vector tracking delay/frequency lock loop (VDFLL) is also used for compensating the change of the code phase error. Besides, the multipath error is estimated with the between-satellite single difference algorithm to further improve the proposed absolute-position-aided (APA) VDFLL code phase discriminator. The real-world static field test demonstrates the proposed algorithm’s high performance in positioning and multipath mitigation.},

New BOC signals, which can perform better in positioning and spectrum compatibility, are frequently used for the modern Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in modern times. BPSK-LIKE and Double Estimator Technique (DET) algorithms are mostly applied to GNSS receivers to cope with the multi-peaks of the Auto-Correlation Function (ACF) of BOC signals. Since the sub-carrier tracking loop of DET has the performance of a narrow pull-in range, it is more likely to be out of lock under dynamic stress. Partially Matched Filter (PMF) is introduced to implement the acquisition process of BOC signals. Fractional Fourier Transform (FRFT) is also included in the acquisition process to estimate the acceleration of the line-of-sight (LOS) signal, and this technique can enhance the sensitivity of the DE-KFL when tracking BOC signals in a highly dynamic environment. Simulations verify that proposed techniques perform significantly better than the original tracking loop. The proposed DE-KFL assisted by the FRFT (A-DE-KFL) algorithm can obviously improve the sensitivity of the tracking loop for BOC signals in a highly dynamic environment.},

  abstract = {Navigation and positioning with GNSS are ubiquitous in our daily lives. However, GNSS receivers are vulnerable to irregular incoming signals, so their positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) performance are usually degraded, especially in urban areas. It is, therefore, essential to enhance the baseband of GNSS receivers to sufficiently adapt to and be robust to volatile environments. Correlator outputs are the elementary products from GNSS baseband signal processing. The navigation and positioning accuracy is highly related to the quality of the correlator outputs, which contain less sophisticated noise sources than the code and carrier errors produced by the traditional tracking loops. In that case, the baseband processor can estimate the actual time of arrival (TOA) more easily. In this work, we directly de-noise the complex correlator outputs in the consecutive time domain to produce more accurate pseudorange measurements in harsh environments. Graph signal processing (GSP) is more extraordinary in alleviating irregular noise power than traditional digital signal processing (DSP). Thus, the GSP is applied to optimize the raw graph signals formed with the correlator outputs varying with the time and code offset. Then, the irregular graph domain is processed with graph Fourier transform (GFT) by exploring the geometry structure of the network of correlator outputs. The proposed GFT filtering method for the consecutive complex correlator outputs is realized in a GNSS software-defined radio (SDR) processing the GPS L1 C/A signals. Then, static GPS intermediate frequency (IF) data are collected in an urban area to test the proposed SDR. The real-world experiments demonstrate that the baseband processing results can be de-noised more efficiently, and the positioning accuracy is improved by 65.3\% compared to the traditional algorithm.},

This paper firstly investigates the dynamic difference of the LOS and NLOS signals for a moving GNSS antenna. Then, the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) algorithm is presented to match the signals with different Doppler rate values in a multipath channel. A long coherent processing interval (CPI) is also adopted to enhance the sensitivity and accuracy of the FRFT match filter. Simulating results demonstrate the high performance for detections towards the LOS/NLOS signals in the fractional Fourier domain (FRFD) based on the proposed FRFT super-resolution algorithm (SRA).},

  abstract = {Current commercial global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers cannot measure the change of Doppler shift via baseband processing. However, positioning in challenging environments demands accurate Doppler estimates to replicate the actual intermediate-frequency (IF) line-of-sight (LOS) GNSS signals. Otherwise, the instantaneous GNSS measurements, like pseudoranges and carrier phases, will be seriously distorted, restricting the upper bound of GNSS positioning. This paper proposes a brand-new super-resolution (SR) GNSS receiver that computes the user’s absolute acceleration based on super-long coherent integration (S-LCI), fractional Fourier transform (FRFT), and a baseband maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). A basic nonlinear least square (NLS) navigator taken as an intuitive example shows how the proposed receiver models and generates averaging Doppler rates via the baseband-dependent gradient descent (GD) algorithm. A global positioning system (GPS) software-defined radio (SDR) processing the L5 IF data collected via a mobile cart in the real world validates the proposed technique with the Doppler rate measurement, the user’s acceleration navigation solution, and the clock drift rate.},

With the dynamic movement of the locomotive, the measurement results are not abundantly enough. It is quite necessary to investigate the methodology for GNSS performance evaluation in signal reception constrained environments using both simulation and field test results together. This will reduce the test complexity and also provide the possibility to compare between different parameters.},

  abstract = {With the advantage of low-cost and high precision, single frequency RTK (SFRTK) is widely used for small unmanned aerial vehicles (SUAVs) that require high precision georeferencing (position and attitude). However, the traditional SFRTK suffers from several limitations such as base station setup and short baseline length. Single frequency precise point positioning (SFPPP) is a GNSS positioning technique that could be used globally since it overcomes the dependency of a base station, enabling the SUAVs a long flight range, and maintaining decimeter-level positioning accuracy at the same time. In this paper, a real-time low-cost SFPPP and MEMS INS loosely coupled georeferencing system for SUAVs is developed and tested under open sky and GNSS challenging environment. Under GNSS challenging environment, reliable detection and removal of carrier phase cycle slips and code gross errors are major challenges in order to achieve robust GNSS positioning solution. The Doppler based phase prediction method is among the commonly used cycle slip detection methods for single frequency receiver but, it will fail when receivers output slipped Doppler. Code gross errors are usually expected to be removed using statistical testing methods, but they often fail when fewer number of satellites signals are tracked in challenging environments. In this paper, apart from a typical loosely coupled INS and GNSS integration, the IMU derived phase and code measurements are utilized for cycle slip and code gross error detection to enhance the robustness of the solution. The experimental results reveal that, the SFPPP comes to convergence within 10 minutes, hereafter the positioning accuracy reaches decimeter-level for horizontal directions, and sub-meter for vertical direction even under obstructed environments like inside a small forest. The attitude accuracy is still under improvement, which currently is 3 degrees for roll/pitch, and 10 degrees for yaw.},

  abstract = {The classification of the line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals is one of the major problems for robust GNSS positioning and the shadow matching in urban environments. The existing techniques include the multi-sensor integration, 3D map aid, using a dual-polarized antenna, an omnidirectional camera aid are proposed to solve the classification problem. However, they all require external hardware or up-to-date map, which is expensive or impractical for mass-market applications. Consistency checking with the receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) is widely used for the detection of NLOS signals, but it is efficient only when the majority of the received signals are LOS signals. Machine learning methods, including the decision tree, the support vector machine (SVM) have been explored to classify LOS and NLOS with good accuracy. However, all current machine learning based method only utilize information within one epoch, all the inter-epoch information and data features in time series are lost, and the information of signal propagation in the complex urban environments is not fully manifested in the Rinex level observation and NMEA level observations in one single epoch. In this paper, a multivariate Long Short Term Memory Fully Convolutional Network (MLSTM-FCN) based signal classification method is proposed. With the aid of the convolution layer and long short term memory block, this method handles the data features in both time domain and value domain. Six time series features of GNSS signal, including differenced C/N0, time differenced ambiguity, double difference phase and pseudorange, phase and pseudorange consistency are analyzed and used as the input of the MLSTM-FCN. Datasets from two locations in the urban Calgary are collected, each of which is used for training and testing purposes respectively. The results reveal that, compared to the SVM classification method, the overall testing accuracy of the newly proposed classifier is improved from 93.00\% to 95.97\% for the Rinex level observation, and from 92.99\% to 93.83 for the NMEA level observation. This improved classification accuracy brought by the proposed classifier is encouraging since it will enhance the robustness of the conventional GNSS positioning and the shadow matching based navigation system by reducing unbounded NLOS signal errors in urban environments and result in significant improvement in positioning accuracy. Compared to the SVM classifier aided single point positioning (SPP) test, the accuracy in the form of RMS of the MLSTM-FCN aided SPP test can be improved by 24.3\%, 17.8\% and 24.4\% in the East, North and Up directions respectively, and the rate of the valid solution can be increased from 99.02\% to 99.94\%. The new method has the potential to be widely applied by various receiver types with the output of the raw observation or only with the NMEA observations output.},

  abstract = {The European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) augments the open public service offered by the GPS in Europe. EGNOS makes GPS suitable for safety critical applications. EGNOS is conceived as an integral part of a multi–modal inter–regional Satellite-Based Augmentation System (SBAS) service that integrates systems designed according to the same standard SARPs (annex 10 vol I) [3] such as US WAAS, Japanese MSAS, GAGAN in India, SDCM in Russia and KAAS in South Korea. EGNOS provides over Europe both corrections and integrity information about the GPS system, delivering opportunities for accurate positioning improving existing applications or developing a wide range of new ones. As the European SBAS, EGNOS offers three services: Open Service, Safety-of-life Service and EDAS. In general, the EGNOS Safety-of-life (SoL) Service is intended for transport applications in different domains (and currently in use by Aviation) where lives could be endangered if the performance of the navigation system is degraded below specific accuracy limits without giving notice in the specified time to alert. This requires that the relevant authority of the particular transport domain determines specific requirements for the navigation service based on the needs of that domain. A new EGNOS service for maritime applications is currently under evaluation with the objective to complement the existing maritime radionavigation systems (e.g. DGNSS) in the European region for enhanced accuracy and integrity information where there is no back-up infrastructure or in poorly covered environments.},

  abstract = {Studying and testing new and possible future GNSS signals and navigation messages require a signal generator which is flexible and fully modifiable. To overcome the need of implementing a signal generator from scratch, we present a way to modify an excising GNSS software receiver (SR) into a software transceiver (ST). The ST reuses the SR modules and the infrastructure for the signal generation. The modification approach is based on exploiting the vector tracking feature of the software receiver. Due to the replacement of the position in the vector tracking loop, it is possible to manipulate the numerical controlled oscillator (NCO) and thereby force the code and carrier generator to generate a signal replica which fits to the induced position. Multiplying the replica with the desired symbol value and the desired amplitude yields an entire line of sight signal. The replica signals of all satellites in tracking match the predefined user trajectory. Saving the added replica signals results in a signal stream of intermediate frequency (IF). The ST is able to track, generate or re-generate tracked signals. The concept and an implementation approach is presented. The signal quality is compared to real signals. The possibilities of the ST are shown by generating Galileo OS signals with navigation message authentication (NMA) and generating a secure code estimation (SCE) attack signal.},

  abstract = {This work presents a new GNSS array processing algorithm to estimate simultaneously the antenna array attitude and the direction of incoming multipath wave fronts. The multipath and attitude estimating phase lock loop (MAEPLL) is a post-correlation technique based on the parallel processing of the prompt correlator values from the antenna elements, forming double-differenced prompt correlator (DDPC) values between antenna elements and satellites. With a geometrical based model of the derived DDPC values the attitude and the multipath direction of arrival (DOA) can be estimated. Non-adaptive beamforming techniques can use the estimated platform attitude and multipath DOA to obtain conventional (not differenced) correlation values. With classical DLL/FLL/PLL filters the position, velocity and timing (PVT) solution is derived after the beamforming process. On the basis of a selfdeveloped wideband multipath channel simulation framework we present our first results for the attitude and multipath DOA estimation accuracy. The results show, that the attitude accuracy is quite independent of the environmental conditions due to the double-differencing. It is also shown, that it is possible to jointly estimate antenna array attitude and multipath direction of arrival. This work outlines the mathematical foundations of a combined multipath and attitude estimation based on DDPC values. The simulation results show attitude accuracies below one degree in all three spatial directions, as well as high robustness in terms of initially assumed attitudes, multipath environments and signal strengths. The MAEPLL technique has the potential to extend the DDPC model to include an estimation of the antenna element phase center corrections (PCCs), enabling the use of cheap, supoptimal, uncalibrated and integrated antenna arrays in mass-market applications with on-the-fly antenna phase center variation calibration.},

  abstract = {The global position precision of High-definition (HD) Map mainly relies on GNSS Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) positioning. RTK solution cannot be fixed in long urban canyon or long tree-lined roads for the non-line-of sight (NLOS) of signal and multi-path effect of signal reflection, consequently, the localization error in relative localization system such as IMU/wheel encoder, visualinertial odometry (VIO), Lidar-inertial odometry (LIO) will drift dramatically. To improve the large drift error under long range GNSS denied environment, a multi-sensor-fusion localization algorithm assisted by pole-like objects registration is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an efficient relative pose observation model for two distant states are built by registration of pole-like object is proposed, in which an effective registration algorithm between pole-like objects detected by point-cloud and that detected by semantic segmentation on image plane algorithm is proposed. Secondly, a multi-sensor-fusion localization system which incorporate pole-like objects registration is proposed to get more precise global positioning result. The evaluation of the method proposed in this paper was carried out by the data acquired from a HD Map acquisition vehicle, the result shows that relative positioning precision improved from 0.5\% distance to 0.18\% distance error, the max absolute positioning error improved from 0.42 meter to 0.18 meter whenever the RTK is unavailable in a tracking distance of 500 meters.},

  abstract = {Indoor navigation and positioning methods are continuously evolving as a result of the diversity of applications. In some wireless high channel traffic areas, indoor navigation is facilitated by various wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi hotspots, Bluetooth beacons and other special signal transmitters. In addition to the use of these technologies, significant performance improvements can be achieved by integrating these systems with data obtained with GNSS receivers. Furthermore, standalone GNSS based indoor positioning is essential for low channel traffic areas like isolated residential complexes and houses where deploying dedicated infrastructure might not be viable. Therefore, regardless of the recent evolution of nonGNSS approaches, there is a need to exploit weak GNSS signals and characterize their behavior in indoor environments. The research presented in this paper focuses on assessing different factors that contribute towards GNSS weak signal detection. There are three main factors that have a major impact on weak signal processing using long term integration, namely short term stability of the receiver clock, accuracy of the estimated trajectory used during integration, and changes in the channel model during integration. Individual contributions due to each one of these are analyzed. Indoor GPS data was collected in different indoor environments, namely commercial concrete building and townhouse with brick walls for the characterization process. Effect of the indoor channel behavior is characterized for a static user and for a moving antenna placed on a linear motion table. Additionally, spatial domain characteristics for two closely placed antennas are analyzed. Finally, data samples are collected for a short period every 30 minutes over a seven-hour window and position estimates are compared to study time domain dependencies. Analyses are supported with measurement and position domain results.},

This paper presents the results of an effort to characterize the errors committed by a specific IAN algorithm. Such a characterization supports the further development of the algorithm by providing a baseline measure of expected filter performance against which future versions may be compared. To accomplish this task, a 100 run collection of inertial and imaging data was performed using a ground vehicle navigating a rectangular indoor path within a controlled environment. This data was processed offline through the prototype IAN algorithm proposed in [14], and a Monte Carlo error analysis performed of the position errors committed by the filter. Such an analysis of an IAN filter based upon a real world data collection of this size does not yet exist in the literature. Examples of filter divergence were seen within the analysis results, and these divergent runs were then examined separately, with an exploration of possible divergence indicators (filter computed covariance and measurement residuals) and suspected causes of the divergent behavior. The results of this work provide a full characterization of the filter committed errors.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a strategy to improve the performance of Ground-Based Augmentation Systems (GBAS) in low latitudes. A methodology was developed for an alerting system that uses surrounding ground stations to monitor the ionosphere state in real time and send alerts to a GBAS facility when threatening conditions are detected. The method is based on time-step gradients used as a test statistic along with data gap analysis to detect ionospheric disturbances and declare periods for affected satellite signals to be declared unavailable. The method for translating detections of threatening conditions into alerts to not use specific satellites depends on three different parameters, and 30 different combinations of these were tested. Validation was performed with real data using the largest observed gradients that form the Brazilian ionospheric threat model. The results demonstrated that the method is highly effective, detecting the vast majority of previously known threatening gradients within a maximum temporal tolerance of 5 minutes. An availability assessment was also performed to check for availability outages resulting from the application of the technique. These outage periods varied significantly with day of year and location. Cases were found in which all threatening gradients were detected without loss of availability. However, in the worst case, the application of the alerting method with the most sensitive set of parameters resulted in an outage period of approximately 5 hours using monitoring stations in the region of the city of Salvador, Brazil. Despite such loss of availability in the worst-case outage, this result is far better than declaring the system totally unavailable every night (when equatorial plasma bubbles typically occur). The application of the developed technique has the potential to improve low-latitude nighttime GBAS availability.},

Experimental validation is performed by fusing inertial measurement unit (IMU) data obtained from the PixHawk 2.1 flight controller with pose measurements from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) Cartographer SLAM, visual odometry provided by the Intel T265 camera and position measurements from the Pozyx ultra-wideband (UWB) indoor positioning system. The estimated odometry from ESEKF is validated against ground truth data from the Optitrack motion capture system and its use in a position control loop to stabilize the UAV is demonstrated.},

  author = {Martin, Scott},
  date = {2017-05-06},
  institution = {{Auburn University}},
  abstract = {In this dissertation, two approaches are developed to improve the carrier phase tracking performance of a software-defined GPS receiver. The first approach combines a non-coherent vector tracking architecture with a local phase locked loop to improve carrier phase tracking performance of a stand-alone (i.e. not base station) GPS receiver. The Vector Frequency Locked Loop (VFLL) aided Phase Locked Loop (PLL) receiver is shown to provide a more robust carrier phase tracking performance at low carrier-to-noise density (C/N0) ratios. The VFLL aided PLL is able to maintain phase lock of signal with 2 to 3 dB lower C/N0 ratio. The more significant improvement is that, while the scalar tracking receiver quickly lost phase lock completely at low C/N0 ratios, the VFLL aided PLL only slipped cycles. The second approach is designed to include measurements from a local base station. The Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) vector phase locked loop receiver is derived. The RTK VPLL receiver is a true carrier phase tracking receiver in that the navigation filter is updated using correlator outputs, and there is no local loop filter for each tracking channel. The tracking loop is closed by predicting the received carrier phase using the navigation solution. Base station measurements are combined with relative position vector estimates from the navigation filter and fixed carrier ambiguities to close the tracking loops. In simulation, the RTK VPLL maintains phase lock at C/N0 ratios 4 to 8 dB lower than a traditional scalar tracking receiver. During experimental testing, the RTK VPLL receiver maintains the navigation solution and carrier phase tracking throughout tests in moderate and heavy foliage. There are times during the experimental test that the RTK VPLL receiver slipped cycles of the carrier, and the navigation solution degrades as a result. The environment prevents the standard receiver from reporting a high precision solution for even longer periods. Finally, the benefits of the RTK VPLL receiver design are investigated in a multiantenna configuration. Data from multiple GPS antennas mounted on a rigid body may be used to estimate the attitude of the platform. The solution for finding the three Euler angles (i.e. roll, pitch, and yaw) of the platform given two relative position vectors is provided. Two studies are performed to identify possible improvements to the software receiver design developed in this dissertation. A modified two antenna RTK VPLL algorithm was developed and tested in simulation. It is shown that the two antenna algorithm does not significantly improve the carrier phase tracking performance at low C/N0 ratios. An RTK carrier ambiguity estimation procedure is developed using the multiple antenna configuration and the known antenna separation distance. The new baseline constrained ambiguity estimation algorithm significantly reduces time to fix and provide a method for rejecting incorrect fixes.},

This paper describes the design and optimization of the ISM generation algorithms performed in the framework of the development of an ARAIM demonstrator (ARTEX). The design started with a critical review of the method to identify the worst Signal In Space Ranging Error (SISRE): an alternative to the Worst User Location approach was developed to avoid the generation of not unimodal SISRE distributions and to optimize the user availability by reducing the ISM parameters. Besides the accurate representation from a statistical point of view of the SISRE distribution was investigated developing a concept to assess sampling rate and number of effective samples. The method to derive consistent set of ISM parameters, ensuring the identification of a continuous bounding curve is also described in this work. Finally the ARAIM single frequency case was investigated and a methodology to monitor instantaneous BGD residuals and their contribution to the satellite fault probabilities was developed. The paper provides a description of these design choices together with the justifications based on real measurements.},

  abstract = {The rapid development of autonomous ground vehicle technologies (AV) and the recent proliferation of unmanned aerial system (UAS) applications motivate the search for appropriate solutions ensuring safe and effective navigation of such autonomous platforms in any operational environment and condition, including situations where air and ground platforms share the same space. Because of the easy availability and efficiency of GNSS (Global Navigation satellite System) for civilian use, GNSS positioning has been widely used in a large variety of consumer applications, in particular in mobile devices and, in fact, it has become an enabling technology for many applications, allowing positioning and navigation of ground and aerial platforms almost everywhere. Since reliable GNSS signal reception cannot be guaranteed in urban and vegetated areas as well as when signals are subject to unintentional and intentional interferences, the provision of alternate and complementary positioning solutions has been of high interest for a long while. One of the applicable techniques is the use of collaborative navigation (CN), where platforms navigating in close vicinity can share navigation information and a joint navigation solution can potentially provide better individual navigation solutions for all platforms. In this work we investigate the feasibility and performance of CN in areas where ground and airborne vehicles operate in the same space. A field test, including multiple ground vehicles and drones was conducted to acquire experimental data to assess accuracy, robustness and accuracy of CN in a simulated intersection area. Initial results of this research work are reported.},

  abstract = {Officially released on August 2016, the Android 7.0 has been a breakthrough for the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) community. Starting with the introduction of its Application Programming Interface 24 (API 24), Android users have been able to directly access raw GNSS measurements within their smartphone, independently on the specific phone design or manufacturer. In this research we consider as a case-study device the Xiaomi Mi 8, equipped with the BCM47755 location hub (first dual-frequency GNSS chipset), after being upgrade to Android 9.0 in order to access new functionalities implemented in the API 28. The analysis of raw measurements and their quality is fundamental in smartphone-based positioning, since biased or extremely noisy estimates of the pseudorange measurements will hamper the precise positioning performances. Here, we report on several tests performed in static mode over a geodetic pillar, under similar conditions and covering time-spans up to several hours. Main quantities retrieved from the API were first described and then characterized based on the statistics retrieved from all these long dataset. After some considerations, a dependency w.r.t. the carrier-to-noise density ratio (C/N0) has been investigated for some of these variables, as well as for the impact of the API multipath indicator on the available observations. Finally, a preliminary C/N0-based trade-off between data ‘quantity’ and ‘quality’ is here proposed in order to support smartphone-based precise positioning.},

In order to obtain an optimal and reliable position estimate using GNSS, it is necessary to have an accurate model of the pseudorange and pseudorange-rate error terms’ distributions.

The proposed methodology was adapted to include dual constellation measurements in the L1 band, GPS L1 C/A and Galileo E1 OS signal measurements.

  abstract = {Satellite clocks play an important role of satellite navigation system, because positioning and navigation using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) are based on ranging measurements of the transmission time of signals from satellites to receivers. There are various sources of errors in ranging measurements, for example, one of them is caused by the error of satellite clocks. Therefore, satellite clock stability is key technology to reduce the ranging measurements errors. Current GNSS carry atomic clocks, however, optical clocks which are much higher frequencies than THz and more stable than the atomic clocks have been developing over the last decades. Furthermore, the iodine-based optical clock which uses an iodine-stabilized laser in combination with an optical frequency comb has the possibility to apply for space crafts. Both iodine frequency reference and optical frequency comb have been launched by sounding rockets. For Precise Point Positioning (PPP), additional information is required such as satellite precise orbit and clock corrections from precise ephemeris, usually IGS products. The accuracy of IGS final products is a few centimeters and influenced by the limitation of clock modelling. A highly stable clock such as optical clocks can support Precise Orbit and clock Determination (POD) to reduce estimated clock modelling errors. In addition, radial orbit errors compensated by satellite clock corrections would be also improved. Thus, if GNSS have more stable clocks, the accuracy of POD would be improved. JAXA simulated POD in the case that Quasi Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) carries the Rubidium Atomic Frequency Standards (RAFS) and the iodine-based optical clock. In this paper, we evaluated the effect of the optical clocks for satellite navigation system, focusing on QZS-1.},

  abstract = {Precise Point Positioning (PPP) is already the preferred technique for GNSS navigation; however, it suffers from a low convergence time that cannot be accepted for multiple applications. This paper expands on the state-of-the-art techniques to address this limitation and considerably decrease the convergence time. The developed algorithm consists of a tightly coupled implementation of inertial data with a multi constellation PPP Ionosphere-Free with Integer Ambiguity Resolution (PPP-IF-IAR). The first step to improve the convergence was to achieve the integer ambiguity resolution in a multi-constellation multi-frequency configuration. The addition of the inertial data proved to be essential in keeping a precise position during the GNSS signal disruptions commonly seen in land applications, moreover it ratified its importance by accelerating the ambiguity resolution. Another focus of this paper is the validation of the algorithm in real kinematic scenarios. The results will be presented as a series of two comparisons. Firstly, the solution will be compared to a Real Time Kinematic (RTK) very short base line reference solution. Secondly, the tightly coupled solution will be compared to the GNSS only PPP-IF-IAR solution.},

This experiment demonstrates the application of current ConvNet-based machine learning design principles combined with novel truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) to provide detection and classification of GNSS signals and spoofers. It can run in real-time on a desktop class computer and can use software defined radios for collection or an appropriate in-phase/quadrature-phase source. This provides a low-cost and lowcomplexity method of detecting GNSS spoofing. It also generalizes to detection of other types of radio frequency interference (RFI). This experiment utilizes the TEXBAT GPS, and OAKBAT GPS and Galileo datasets to demonstrate supervised model classification performance. It also provides results from adapting the same type of classification model to an autoencoder-based unsupervised anomaly detection system that can be conducted in real-time on a system without training data.},

With regard to global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs), such as the global positioning system (GPS), signal simulation tools help with the design of software defined receivers and allow for testing of error mitigation. With recent research featuring navigation with signals of opportunity and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, a signal simulation tool is applicable here as well. In this paper a signal simulation tool for LEO satellite navigation is developed. This simulation tool is block-like to provide flexibility to the user which allows for fast testing of various signal types and constellations. The simulation in this paper focuses on two LEO constellations, Iridium and Orbcomm. To demonstrate the simulation tool, a navigation signal is designed for both constellations. Then, the broadcast of this signal is simulated. A receiver is designed to process the simulated signal, and a navigation solution is computed. This simulation tool shows effectiveness at simulating multiple LEO constellations and generates realistic signals that receivers can process.},

Theoretical performance calculations depend on a large number of variables including receiver-specific parameters such as effective antenna aperture, observation time, observation frequency, receiver bandwidth, and noise sources, along with various parameters specific to the pulsar under observation, such as flux density, pulse period, and pulse width. The achievable performance is additionally subject to such real-world constraints as the local radio-frequency interference (RFI) environment, receiver hardware specifications, and available computational power. An experimental approach is therefore necessary to determine a set of reasonable parameters for a practical system, measure the performance that can be achieved using these parameters, and demonstrate the validity of theoretical models.},

This study aims to find one or more DOP metrics that can be used to predict the navigation accuracy of any navigation system using carrier Doppler shift and pseudorange measurements. The study then considers how these DOP metrics can be used for LEO navigation constellation design. The OneWeb constellation is used as an example for constellation design based on DOP metrics.},

Combining a weak signal with a long spreading code results in many computations and, therefore, a very large TTFA. Frequency domain techniques are implemented to reduce the TTFA of these BOC codes. Matlab has been used to test the techniques off-line. In order to determine a realistic TTFA, however, the different algorithms have also been implemented on a practical DSP that is optimized for signal processing functions. The TTFA on the DSP has been found to be larger than in Matlab. It is believed this is due to stalls caused by accessing slower memory external to DSP. While the DSP results are not as good as expected, the ability to acquire long BOC codes on a commercially available DSP in degraded signal environments through the use of different FFT algorithms and techniques is demonstrated.},

Ambiguties inherent to the magnetic signal may be mitigated by fusing the filter with additional measurements, most accessibly from an accelerometer. Acceleration measurements can be used to improve the measurement update step by providing additional information for likelihood estimation. This approach was tested against a magnetometer-only filter and found improvements in the best-case and average performance, but greater variability in maximum error and decreased filter stability. Additionally, it was used to help gauge navigability and recoverability in instances of attempted localization not on the mapped route. Both approaches could recover from brief diversions from the map but could not overcome longer diversions that skipped segments of the map. Also introduced to help positioning estimation is spatial correlation analysis, a likelihood technique that takes into account multiple navigation samples and signal scaling. This technique is found to be competitive in accuracy but much more computationally demanding than the traditional aggregate bin likelihood technique.},

  abstract = {Attitude Determination (AD) constitutes an important navigation component for vehicles that require orientation information, such as spacecraft or ships. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) enable resolving the orientation of a vehicle in a precise and absolute manner, by employing a setup of multiple GNSS antennas rigidly mounted onboard the tracked vehicle. To achieve high-precision attitude estimation based on GNSS, the use of carrier phase observations becomes indispensable, with the consequent added complexity of resolving the integer ambiguities. The use of inertial aiding has been extensively exploited for AD, since it enables tracking fast rotation variations and bridging short periods of GNSS outage. In this work, the fusion of inertial and GNSS information is exploited within the recursive Bayesian estimation framework, applying an Error State Kalman Filter (ESKF). Unlike common Kalman Filters, ESKF tracks the error or variations in the state estimate, posing meaningful advantages for AD. On the one hand, ESKF represents attitude using a minimal state representation, in form of rotation vector, avoiding attitude constraints and singularity risks on the covariance matrix estimates. On the other hand, second-order products on the derivation of the Jacobian matrices can be neglected, since the errorstate operates always close to zero. This work details the procedure of recursively estimating the attitude based on the fusion of GNSS and inertial sensing. The GNSS attitude model is parametrized in terms of quaternion rotation, and the overall three-steps AD procedure (float estimation, ambiguity resolution and solution fixing) is presented. The method performance is assessed on a Monte Carlo simulation, where different noise levels, number of satellites and baseline lengths are tested. The results show that the inertial aiding, along with a constrained attitude model for the float estimation, significantly improve the performance of attitude determination compared to classical unaided baseline tracking.},

  abstract = {Location information is fundamental in nowadays society and key for prospective driverless vehicles and a plethora of safety-critical applications. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) constitute the main information supplier for outdoor positioning, with worldwide all-weather availability. While the use of GNSS carrier phase observations leads to precise location estimates, its performance can be easily jeopardized in urban scenarios, where satellite availability may be limited or observations may be corrupted by harsh propagation conditions. The satellite shortage is especially relevant for Real Time Kinematic (RTK), whose capability to estimate a precise positioning solution rapidly decays with weak observation models. To address this limitation, this article introduces the concept of collaborative RTK (C-RTK), an approach to precise positioning using swarms of vehicles, where a set of users participate in the vehicle network. The idea is that users with good satellite visibility assist users that evolve in constrained environments. This work introduces the C-RTK functional model, an estimation solution and associated performance bounds. Illustrative Monte Carlo simulation results are provided, which highlight that, by exploiting the crosscorrelation terms present among the users’ observations, C-RTK improves their positioning their of accuracy and availability.},

  abstract = {As Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) become increasingly important for the application of autonomous transportation, the characterization of the uncertainty present in GNSS signals has been a recurrent topic in the GNSS community. With multipath being the most pronounced source of error while navigating during challenging scenarios, characterizing this process is a growing requirement. Improper modeling of the measurements variances can reduce the accuracy of the estimation as much as a gross bias on these measurements. It is therefore required to have reliable and statistically meaningful modeling of errors. To isolate the multipath from the other error sources, the dual-frequency iono-corrected code-minus-carrier combination (CMC) is employed. Conjugate prior Bayesian analysis is used to characterize the variance of the multipath effect to later regress the unknown parameter of the proposed error models. For the derivation of these models, massive amounts of multi-frequency GPS and Galileo data was collected. The comparison between the proposed models was carried out with actual data from a challenging signal-degraded scenario, in terms of positioning and integrity monitoring performance.},

These proposed methods utilize contemporary cryptographic standards. However, quantum computing poses a threat to currently existing authentication schemes that may render them insecure. Thus, it is vital to implement authentication methods that are quantum resistant to protect GNSS and SBAS signals well into the future. This paper briefly discusses the impact of quantum computing on contemporary cryptographic standards. A review of the post-quantum digital signature authentication schemes from the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization competition is presented. Schemes that are applicable to GNSS and SBAS authentication are then identified. Next, a brief introduction to multivariate cryptography is presented. The paper concludes with a discussion on how the post-quantum schemes can used to authenticate GNSS and SBAS data.},

  abstract = {Safety-of-life applications often rely on the PNT solutions provided by GNSS receivers, as well as the informed uncertainty of the estimated states. According to the 2008 US Federal Radionavigation Plan, integrity can be defined as the "measure of the trust that can be placed in the correctness of the information supplied by a navigation system". Therefore, measurements of integrity show, in general lines, the similarity between the provided uncertainties and the actual error of the solution. In this context, this paper approaches the often over-optimistic GNSS error model employing machine-learning algorithms in order to improve integrity measurements for the end-user by maximizing the information output of the filter. The possibility of achieving high-integrity solutions in a low-cost mass-market platform creates an opportunity for a large realm of applications, such as beyond visual line of sight UAV operation, vehicles in precision agriculture, marine applications, and others. This paper makes use of Allystar’s HD8040D dual-band GNSS receiver RTK solution, even though the proposed methods can be applied for any processing strategy such as single-point positioning, differential GNSS, or precise point positioning. As results, even though the EKF-derived integrity measurements outperformed the machine learning strategy in terms of nominal operation, the information derived from the EKF was lower than the other methods. This indicates that information from the measurements is lost at the filter level when attempting to increase the nominal integrity behavior. The Neural Network (NN) model was able to increase the information metric by almost 20-fold, as well as reducing the unavailable points when compared with the other machine learning models. For applications that rely on information from the filter, the Decision Tree algorithm presents a middle ground between the EKF and NN solutions. All machine learning models considered are suitable for real-time, and count with hardware acceleration in some embedded platforms.},

  abstract = {In the context of Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) positioning, the vast majority of applications expect, or even require, the precision level provided by the fixed solution.The required fixed ambiguity terms can be estimated trivially, being the step known as the "validation," the one with challenging aspects. Once the ambiguity terms are estimated, the validation step attempts to verify whether the set of ambiguities is likely to be corresponding to the real number of integer carrier-phase cycles from satellite to receiver’s antenna. Upon failing to discriminate a good solution from a poor solution, the filter state estimation becomes susceptible to wrong fixes, deteriorating the integrity of the estimated position. In this context, this paper approaches an improvement of the ratio test ambiguity validation by the lenses of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) machine learning classifier. A large dataset of kinematic data in urban environments were utilized to train the GA function to discriminate "good" and "bad" fixes. This discrimination is performed by estimating an adaptive validation threshold and comparing the method with a ratio test solution for validating ambiguities. Four aspects are assessed: The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the percentage of fixed epochs, percentage of wrong fixes, and overall solution accuracy. The results show that the GA method can approximate the validation test to the global maximum of the likelihood function and classify wrong fixes as well as good fixes better than a traditional ratio test at its optimum performance. At its optimum classifying point, the GA method outperformed the traditional ratio test in all categories considered, showing improvements of 48\% in accuracy, 71.73\% in dispersion, and 24.15\% in the 95th percentile of solutions. Considering that this method can be applied in real-time on a mass-market GNSS receiver, the achieved results show a promising novel method for many applications requiring low-cost, and reliable results.},

A research spoofing generator will contribute to assess the threat of spoofing attack and help the anti-spoofing research. But the recent commercial of the shelf (COTS) spoofing generator are expensive and the technology implementation is sophisticated and complicated. To address the above problem and promote the GNSS safety-critical applications, a spoofing generator using vector tracking-based software-defined receiver is proposed in this paper. The spoofing generator aims to modify the raw signals by cancelling the actual signal. The connections between the spreading code and carrier and the states of the victim/spoofed receiver are established through vector-tracking. The actual signal can be predicted effectively and the spoofing signal will be generated at the same time. The experiment test results show that the spoofing attack signal can mislead the victim receiver to the designed trajectory effectively. Neither the tracking channels nor the positioning observations has abnormal changes during this processing period. The recent anti-spoofing methods cannot detect this internal spoofing easily. The proposed spoofing generator can cover all open-sky satellites with a good quality of concealment. With the superiority of programmability and diversity, it is believed that the proposed spoofing generator method based on an open source software-defined receiver with vector tracking architecture has a great value for GNSS anti-spoofing researches.},

  abstract = {Advanced Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (ARAIM) is a new technology that will provide worldwide coverage of vertical guidance in aviation navigation. The ARAIM performance and improvement under depleted constellations is a practical problem that needs to be faced and researched further. Firstly, the impacts of one satellite outage on different constellations are analyzed and compared. The conclusion is that GPS is more sensitive and vulnerable to the one satellite outage. Then, a mitigation method based on constellation weighted ARAIM (CW-ARAIM) is proposed. The position solution is replaced by a constellation weighted average solution to eliminate the constellation difference. The new solution will move close to the constellation solutions with respect to the accuracy requirement. The simulation results under baseline GPS and Galileo dual-constellation show that the one GPS satellite outage will knock the availability from 91\% to only 50\%. The performance remains stable with one Galileo satellite outage. With the assistance of the CW-ARAIM method, the availability can increase from 50\% to more than 80\% under depleted GPS configurations. The test results under optimistic constellations further verify that a balanced constellation is more important than more satellites on orbit and the superiority of CW-ARAIM method is still effective.},

This new paradigm can be disruptive with respect to the conventional MEO approach. Actually, from a policy point of view, the feeling is that, in the long term scenario where such a system will flight, a user terminal can potentially exploit thousands of signals, whose small percentage is transmitted by the MEO GNSS. This can be referred to as “MEO shadowing”. This paper works in the opposite direction, trying to assess how fundamental the core MEO-GNSS infrastructure is not only for the effective deployment of the LEO-PNT services, but also for the MEO GNSS evolution. A change of perspective should be considered.},

  abstract = {On-orbit inspection is often a necessary prerequisite to satellite operations such as servicing and debris removal. In particular, multiple inspectors collaborating to inspect an unknown object can result in a faster and more comprehensive inspection. The contribution of this research is to provide a reliable, computationally efficient estimate for the position of each agent relative to a target in a multi-agent inspection. First, an overview of the problem dynamics, background, and methods used to build and solve a factor graph-based estimation technique is provided. Through the implementation of a Sliding Window (SW) filter, a factor graph can be applied to long duration scenarios while reducing processing requirements for estimation. An example scenario of three agents attempting to conduct an inspection while susceptible to a Sun exclusion zone that nulls some measurement information is prescribed. Development continues by comparing results for the developed Sliding Window Factor Graph (SWFG) against two extreme SW sizes of interest: an iterative Kalman filter (SW size = 1) and a full factor graph (SW size ≥ scenario duration). Results reveal the impact of both the Sun exclusion zone and sliding window size on estimation quality and computation time.},

  abstract = {In 2020, Hexagon announced a breakthrough in global Precise Point Positioning (PPP), demonstrating significant reductions in convergence time with global RTK From the Sky™ technology. This technology has since been incorporated into Hexagon’s TerraStar™ services, for production use in global applications. These advancements were the result of an end-to-end modernization of Hexagon’s global correction services technology, from reference station hardware and software to the positioning rover algorithms. At the heart of the TerraStar service is the Orbit and Clock Determination System (OCDS). This paper will explore OCDS and how it is at the core of what makes global RTK From the Sky technology possible. The expansion of the constellations from dual-frequency to triple-frequency or quad-frequency means that there is more information available to improve the network processing performance, but it comes at the cost of processing time and complexity. A creative software design was used to integrate the new signals into the processing and accommodate the very high computation requirements a creative software design is used. The OCDS corrections (precise satellite orbits and clocks, and satellite-specific biases for individual signals, also referred to as “State Space Representation”) are used by PPP with Ambiguity Resolution (PPPAR) positioning algorithms. The design of these corrections allows for one-way, mass-distribution of correction data via satellite or Internet broadcast. The OCDS system supports the commercial TerraStar, Oceanix, and Apex Correction Services used across land, near-shore and marine applications, respectively. The improved performance due to the evolution of the OCDS system enables new applications and significant advances in traditional markets. This paper will highlight some of these applications and demonstrate how the software design and implementation changes impact the application performance. Performance metrics and results will be shown highlighting the improvements that this new system design, with its additional signals, provides over the legacy, dual-frequency system.},

  abstract = {Applications across multiple industries require Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) for high-precision positioning. However, the standalone GNSS performance using the typical, low-cost GNSS devices in vehicles today is insufficient to achieve the positioning and availability needed for instantaneous lane-level accuracy on connected vehicles at scale. The antenna and receiver hardware available in standard vehicles limits the position accuracy and convergence performance. These limitations make the positioning more susceptible to local error sources like receiver multipath, noise, carrier tracking stability, etc. To work within the constraints of automotive-grade GNSS devices and achieve the performance required for lane-level positioning, GNSS correction services with additional design considerations and sophisticated algorithms are needed. NovAtel’s TerraStar X technology enables these applications and consists of many components, including a network of reference stations, data dissemination links, innovative messaging formats, account management and monitoring tools. At the heart of this service is the Orbit and Clock Determination System (OCDS). The OCDS produces a set of corrections precise satellite orbits and clocks, and satellite-specific biases for individual signals augmented by the computation of additional regional corrections. The addition of regional corrections enables automotive and mass-market applications to achieve in-lane positioning within seconds, using any dual-frequency, dual-constellation GNSS hardware. This paper outlines the design and performance of the combined OCDS and regional correction system. The result is cutting-edge software that provides a continuous stream of multi-constellation, multi-frequency GNSS corrections, enabling a correction service that enables the affordable GNSS device ecosystem. We demonstrate the performance of the TerraStar X technology across a variety of applications. In addition to providing support for lane-level positioning in less than a minute for automotive applications, regional corrections are shown to improve the performance of survey-grade GNSS receivers.},

Methods to detect such tin-can attacks are proposed where an array of antennas or a dual-polarized antenna is used.

This paper presents spoofing detection and spoofing attack classification using lightweight spatial and acquisition metrics from a snapshot receiver. Further, appropriate machine learning (ML) techniques provide high performance and intuition. The results show that spatial information (i.e., multi-antenna comparisons) has superior spoofing detection, but incorporating the acquisition metrics (i.e., temporal information) facilitates spoofing attack type classification. Finally, only basic acquisition metrics are required for classification, demonstrating lightweight feature selection and training. This work shows that spoofing detection and attack type classification is possible and emphasizes that a low feature space is required.},

  abstract = {Privacy protection devices (PPDs) are cheap and freely available global navigation satellite system (GNSS) jammers which interfere with GNSS receivers. This causes major disruption, and therefore these interferences should be mitigated by receivers. Adaptive notch filtering (ANF) is an effective interference mitigation method against PPDs, as these interferences tend to transmit chirp-like signals. However, ANF requires a processing rate that exceeds the data rate of the signal for real-time applications. A wavelet based adaptive notch filter (WANF) is proposed as a method to parallelize the processing. This method uses a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to separate the signal into multiple channels, where ANF can be done at a reduced processing rate, before the signal is reconstructed again. This mitigation method is tested against real PPDs signals, as well as being compared to other popular mitigation methods. Results show that the WANF has superior performance to ANF, and is considered an effective method against PPDs. Further, the WANF is more robust against to a non-flat spectrum but it does cause inter-channel mixing in the presence of strong interferences. The WANF is an improvement to the performance and robustness of ANF, but requires more processing resources, however, it can be parallelized, making it an enabler of ANF especially for high data rate reception channels.},

  abstract = {Sensor calibration is an important step in obtaining useful measurements for an autonomous vehicle. Sensor fusion, in particular, relies on the proper calibration of sensors. Autonomous vehicles are generally designed with a fixed sensor suite. However, this limits the placement and usage of the sensors. Additionally, a manual calibration routine is required before the vehicle can be used. This calibration routine needs to be performed by a set of trained experts to a high degree of precision that requires time and specialized instruments. To enable dynamic reconfiguration of sensors, this work proposes a novel online method to autonomously calibrate an inertial measurement unit (IMU) directly to the vehicle frame. Once the self-calibration has been performed, the other sensors on the vehicle can be calibrated relative to the IMU. The self-calibration is conducted in a two-stage process. First, a Gaussian Radial Basis Function Neural Network is used to emulate an IMU for an arbitrary fixed control point on the vehicle. Then, a constrained maximum likelihood search method performs an IMU-to-IMU calibration between an IMU placed on the body of the vehicle, and the emulated IMU at the control point. The IMU emulation method obtains high-fidelity acceleration estimates on both simulated and experimental data sets. The maximum likelihood search method obtains sensor position estimates within 2 mm of the true sensor location in every direction and within 0.1 degrees of the true sensor orientation for a battery of tests in simulation.},

  abstract = {Extrinsic sensor calibration is a crucial step in obtaining useful navigation information for an autonomous vehicle. However, manual calibration is costly and must be performed by a trained professional. An online autonomous calibration routine would resolve these issues, and allow for dynamic reconfiguration of sensors by the end user. The primary barrier to such a calibration routine is the lack of a reliable Sensor-to-Vehicle calibration method around which the other Sensor-to-Sensor calibrations can be referenced. Previous work has focused on generating a feasible method of estimating IMU-to-Vehicle extrinsic calibration parameters with limited information. However, none of these methods have yet achieved accuracy at or above the industry standard. This work proposes a novel method to improve direct IMU-to-Vehicle extrinsic calibration by fusing information from multiple IMUs on board the vehicle. A weighted nonlinear least squares approach is used to simultaneously estimate the calibration parameters of a number of IMUs relative to the vehicle frame. Each pair of IMUs generates an additional IMU-to-IMU calibration that is weighted according to the error characteristics of the measurements in the least squares estimator. These IMUto-IMU calibrations constrain the combined IMU-to-Vehicle pose, resulting in improved IMU-to-Vehicle pose estimates. A battery of tests in simulation was conducted to validate the proposed Multi-IMU calibration method, and assess its performance as a function of the number of IMUs mounted on the vehicle, as well as the error characteristics of those IMUs.},

Despite their ubiquitous use, GNSS signals are very vulnerable to both intentional and unintentional forms of radio frequency interference (RFI). This paper supports the development of a low-cost GNSS RFI monitor that can reliably enhance a user’s spatial awareness with respect to the state of RFI in their local environment. Multiple jamming experiments are conducted using an anechoic chamber to analyze the response of three different receivers to both wideband and narrowband forms of jamming. The power level of the jamming signal is varied to show how changes affect recorded metrics in the receiver. Specifically, the automatic gain control (AGC), the carrier-to-noise power density ratio (CN0), spectrum, and position information are valuable in understanding the receiver’s state. These results provide a reference for calibrating low-cost receivers when monitoring for interference.},

  abstract = {The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is an important tool that is vulnerable to both intentional and unintentional radio frequency interference (RFI). This work seeks to develop a low-cost GNSS RFI monitor to detect and classify interference in an area. We present multiple signal combination-based jamming and spoofing experiments and provide an analysis of the results. Several simulated short duration jamming tests are applied to both L1 and L2 signals with four types of jamming interference, including continuous wave, narrowband jamming; broadband, additive white Gaussian noise jamming; chirp interference; and pulsed-chirp interference. A lift-off spoofing experiment combines real-time GNSS signals using two receiveonly antennas and a programmable attenuator. The signals are processed using a low-cost u-blox F9P receiver and various power and signal quality metrics are analyzed. Specifically, the carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N0), the automatic gain control (AGC), and spectral analyses are useful for both identifying interference and classifying types of interference. Differences in power metric responses are observed depending on the characteristics and waveform of the jamming interference. Analyzing the position solution in addition to power metric and signal quality monitoring is found to be especially insightful in detecting the presented spoofing scenario. Our results characterize how the u-blox F9P receiver measures the several types of RFI and show the advantages of monitoring multiple metrics when monitoring for interference.},

Utilizing low-correlation spreading codes would enable GPS to provide improved navigation performance as well as incorporate a greater number of navigation signals, which further improves redundancy and accuracy.

  abstract = {To protect civilian GPS users from spoofing, the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) has developed the Chips-Message Robust Authentication (Chimera) signal enhancement for the GPS L1C signal. With Chimera, standalone receivers which only have access to the GPS signal will be able to authenticate their received measurements once every 3 minutes, while users with access to an out-of-band source will be able to perform authentication once every 1.5 or 6 seconds. However, moving receivers typically rely on much faster real-time GPS update rates of between 1-20 Hz. In this work, we design a spoofing-resilient filter framework which provides continuous and secure state estimation between Chimera authentication times. By leveraging self-contained sensors on-board the vehicle, such as an inertial measurement unit (IMU) or wheel encoder, as well as the periodic Chimera authentication, our proposed filter determines how much to rely on the received, unauthenticated GPS measurements for state estimation. In this respect, our filter relies more extensively on GPS measurements in order to improve real-time navigation performance and reduce localization errors when GPS is authentic, while also successfully mitigating spoofing-induced errors during an experienced attack. We experimentally validate our proposed spoofing-resilient filter in a simulated test environment for a ground vehicle model with access to the 3-minute Chimera channel, under various simulated spoofing attack scenarios. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first adaptive filter proposed for Chimera which continuously leverages the real-time GPS measurements in a spoofing-resilient manner.},

  abstract = {The advances in low-latency communications networks combined with the paradigm of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have opened a number of opportunities to develop network-based collaborative positioning and navigation. Recent research works indeed, have fostered the concept of networked Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers supporting the sharing of raw measurements with other receivers connected to the network. Such measurements (i.e. pseudorange and Doppler) can be processed through Differential GNSS techniques to retrieve inter-receiver distances which can be in turn integrated to improve positioning performance. This paper investigates an improved Bayesian estimation for a sensorless (i.e. unavailable Inertial Navigation Sytem (INS)), tight-integration of Differential-GNSS-based collaborative measurements through a modified Particle Filter (PF). Differently from Hybrid Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) indeed, a PF natively support the non-Gaussian noise distribution characterizing GNSS-based inter-receiver distances. The proposed PF was hence designed, implemented and optimized according to the architecture of a proprietary INS-free Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) software receiver and tested with realistic Radio-Frequency (RF) signals, thus showing remarkable improvement in positioning accuracy.},

  abstract = {Long-term stability and accurate time synchronization are at the core of timing network facilities in several critical infrastructures, such as in telecommunication networks. In these applications, timing signals disciplined by Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers, i.e., One Pulse-per-Second (1-PPS), complement Primary Reference Time Clocks (PRTCs) by compensating for long-term drifts of their embedded atomic clocks. However, GNSS receivers may expose timing distribution networks to Radio Frequency (RF) vulnerabilities being the cause of possible degraded or disrupted synchronization among the nodes. This paper presents a test methodology assessing the resilience of new GNSS timing receivers to different classes of intentional RF interferences. The analysis of the results compares the effects of practicable spoofing and meaconing attacks on the 1-PPS generated by three Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) GNSS timing receivers, currently employed in timing applications. On one hand, the results emphasised the robustness of State-of-the-Art (SoA) mitigation technologies compared to previous generations’ devices. On the other hand, the vulnerability of SoA receivers to meaconing attacks highlights the limits of such mitigation solutions that may turn to severe effects on telecommunication networks’ performance.},

Moving from such theoretical findings, this work aims at investigating the CRLB of hybrid estimators integrating auxiliary measurements obtained from the combination of satellite-based range measurements shared among pairs of connected receivers. The study is conceived to inspect the benefits of this GNSS-based collaborative positioning approach in terms of precision improvement. The analysis of such a theoretical limit aims at identifying when the use of cooperative ranges is beneficial despite of their correlation with the individual measurements, according to the geometry of satellites and terrestrial agents w.r.t. a target agent. The theoretical analysis is validated by simulation by demonstrating when the collaborative measurements increases the precision of the position estimates. The study practically provides a methodology for the selection of the best cooperating agents in multi-agent frameworks.},

  abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS) are nowadays widely integrated among mass-market devices, thus merging the benefits of satellite-based absolute positioning and continuity, low-noise and high-rate measurements from a variety of proprioceptive sensors. Other technologies such as Ultra-wideband (UWB), Lidar and cameras allow to passively retrieve range measurements, thus providing additional data suitable for the integration with GNSS. However, they work only if Line-Of-Sight propagation is granted. To overcome this limitation, previous work have introduced the Inter Agent Range (IAR) concept as a mean based on GNSS-only measurement shared by collaborative peers. This paper aims at evaluating the feasibility of a GNSS/IAR tight integration by means of a proper Extended Kalman Filter of such collaborative measurements and satellite-to-receiver ranges, exploiting a communication network infrastructure (i.e. 5G). Intermediate estimation stages are presented to support computation and integration of IAR for receivers which face poor positioning performances. The analysis of the different sources of uncertainty is also provided by means of a simulation environment. Furthermore, the performance on realistic trajectories are discussed for the proposed solution and evaluated by taking into account the communication delays between the agents.},

The paper explores the properties of the different sensors available on a smartphones and evaluates their potential for spoofing and jamming detection.

Afterward, we present the state of the art Application Programming Interface (API) that provides SIMD capable methods for the main components in the receiver operation, including the first of its kind parallelized code and carrier generation using lookup tables and the Neon Arm instructions. The library was developed using the Neon Arm intrinsic engine, which are a C type nomenclature, offering access to the assembly instructions originally designed for the Arm family processors. This design paradigm presents an advantage in terms of readability and simplified code development to accommodate future modifications.

For example, in aerial refueling, the two vehicles are the fueling tanker and the vehicle being refueled. We refer to these vehicles as the leader and follower respectively. In these applications the absolute navigation information of the leader and follower is less important than the relative navigation information between them. We call this information Relative Time Space Positioning Information or Relative TSPI. Traditionally, algorithms employing application specific approximations were developed to provide Relative TSPI. For aerial refueling it was assumed that the vehicles will be flying in close formation and it was further assumed that there is a similarity between the dynamic motions of each aircraft. For autonomous landings the assumptions were based on a reduced-order model of the relative inertial error process.},

In the system, raw observations from the GPS and IMU of the Secondary are transmitted to the Primary through a datalink. The Primary uses this data to determine its Relative Position, Navigation, Time (PNT) to the Secondary.

The scenario includes several Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) and/or dismounted soldiers operating in a GPS challenged or denied environment and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) flying above the environment with access to GPS signals. The goal is a collaborative navigation architecture to provide relative position, velocity and attitude from the UAV to ground units. An evaluation of the performance of the collaborative navigation system was conducted on real-world data. A UAV instrumented with a payload consisting of GPS, MEMS IMU, LiDAR, and RGB Camera was flown over an area where several vehicles/people (features) were operating. The UAV is denoted as the Secondary unit. During GPS outages, the vision sensor onboard the UAV was used to detect and track the features. Each feature tracked is denoted as a primary unit, and the relative position obtained from the UAV was used in the relative navigation filter for each primary/secondary pair. Results show improved navigation performance when utilizing the relative observations during GPS outages. Specifically, the drift of the INS solution is bounded by the external measurements provided by the relative Extended Kalman Filter and the tracking filter when GPS is unavailable, maintaining the desired performance in GPS adverse conditions.},

  abstract = {Precise point positioning (PPP) is highly dependent on the precise ephemerides and satellite clock products that are used. Different ephemeris and clock products are available from a variety of different organizations. The aim of this paper is to assess the achievable static positioning accuracy and precision when using different precise ephemerides from three analysis centres Natural Resources Canada (EMX), European Space Agency (ESA) and GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ), using GPS alone, GLONASS alone, and GPS and GLONASS combined. It will be shown in this paper that the precise products are significantly affected by the time-base of the reference stations, and that this is propagated through to all the estimated satellite clocks. In order to overcome the combined biases in the estimated satellite clock, in the PPP processing, these clocks errors need to be handled with an appropriate variation in the estimated receiver clock. It will also be shown that the precise coordinates of the satellites differ between the analysis centres, and this affects the PPP position estimation at the millimetre level. However, all those products will be shown to result in the same level of precision for all coordinate components and are equivalent to the horizontal precision from a Global Double Difference (GDD) solution. For the horizontal coordinate component, the level of agreement between the PPP solutions, and with the GDD solution, is at the millimetre level. There is a notable, but small, bias in the north coordinate components of the PPP solutions, from the corresponding north component of the GDD solutions. It is shown that this difference is due to the different strategy adopted for the GDD and PPP solutions, with PPP being more affected by the changing satellite systems. The precision of the heights of the receiver sites will be shown to be almost the same across all the PPP scenarios, with all three products. Finally, it will be concluded that accuracy of the height component is system dependent and is related to the behaviour of antenna phase centre with the different constellation type.},

  abstract = {Smartphone receivers comprise about 1.5 billion GNSS receivers currently manufactured in the world. Smartphone receivers provide measurements with lower signal levels and higher noise. Due to constraints on size, weight, power consumption, and cost, it is challenging to provide accurate positioning with these receivers, especially in urban environments. Traditionally, the GPS measurements are processed using model-based approaches, such as Weighted Least-Squares and Kalman filtering. While model-based approaches can provide meter-level positioning accuracy in a post-processing manner, they need strong assumptions on the noise models and require manual tuning of parameters such as covariances. In contrast, learning-based approaches have been proposed that make less assumptions about the data structure and can accurately model environmentspecific errors. However, these approaches provide lower accuracy than model-based methods and are sensitive to initialization. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework for learning position correction which is the offset between the true receiver position and the estimated position. For learning-based approach, we propose a Graph Convolution Neural Network (GCNN) that can learn different graph structures with multi-constellation and multi-frequency signals. For better initialization of the GCNN, we use a Kalman filter to estimate a coarse receiver position. We also use such a coarse receiver position to condition the input features to the graph. We test our proposed approach on the Google Smartphone Decimeter Challenge (GSDC) real-world datasets and show improved positioning performance over model-based methods such as Weighted Least-Squares and Kalman filter.},

  abstract = {Adopting a joint approach towards state estimation and integrity monitoring results in unbiased integrity monitoring unlike traditional approaches. So far, a joint approach was used in Particle RAIM [l] for GNSS measurements only. In our work, we extend Particle RAIM [l] to a GNSS-camera fused system for joint state estimation and integrity monitoring. To account for vision faults, we derive a probability distribution over position from camera images using map-matching. We formulate a Kullback-Leibler Divergence [2] metric to assess the consistency of GNSS and camera measurements and mitigate faults during sensor fusion. The derived integrity risk upper bounds the probability of Hazardously Misleading Information (HMI). Experimental validation on a real-world dataset shows that our algorithm produces less than 11 m position error and the integrity risk over bounds the probability of HMI with 0.11 failure rate for an 8 m Alert Limit in an urban scenario.},

  abstract = {For safe urban navigation, we need a framework for GNSS-camera fusion that provides reliable positioning in the presence of measurement faults. Traditional fault mitigation methods either provide only point positioning estimates and/or detect faults and estimate the state sequentially. Our prior particle filtering framework performed state estimation and fault mitigation jointly under a single optimization framework. However, it loosely coupled GNSS-camera measurements. Furthermore, it derived a camera measurement likelihood using map-matching, which was computationally expensive at inference time, required access to a database of images, and was less robust to vision faults. In this work, we tightly couple GNSS-camera measurements within a particle filtering framework while mitigating measurement faults with an M-estimator. We also propose a data-driven method method using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that is fast at inference time and more robust to vision faults. We validate our framework on a real-world urban driving dataset. Our method achieves lower positioning error than baseline methods under multiple GNSS and camera measurement faults.},

  abstract = {Drifting provides insights into how autonomous cars handle excursions past stable limits. So far, autonomous drifting has been demonstrated for a single car where GPS carrier phase measurements provide cm-level accuracy in absolute position via base station corrections. We aim to extend the single car drifting to tandem drifting. However, in autonomous tandem drifting, it is hard to guarantee cm-level accuracy in relative position using standalone carrier phase measurements since noisier drift dynamics create a large search space of integer ambiguities which makes integer fixing challenging. We propose a precise relative positioning framework for tandem drifting where we use drift dynamics to aid carrier phase measurements. Utilizing drift dynamics, we create an a priori estimate of relative position that constrains the physical search space, and the induced integer search space. To improve integer ambiguity fixing rate, we adaptively adjust the integer search space based on the noise in drift dynamics. We demonstrate our algorithm’s performance on a simulated tandem drifting case. Our algorithm achieves cm-level accuracy even with noisy GPS measurements and shows improved positioning over conventional methods such as LAMBDA.},

The performance of the estimator is evaluated using a simulated case study of aircraft using ADS-B/TCAS to cooperatively aid their on board INS during a 60 min GPS outage in the national airpsace.The proposed estimator combines the Supplemented Partitioning Approach with Covariance Intersection. It is shown that this estimator yields conservative results. It is also shown to be flexible in that it places no restrictions on the size of the community or the source selection protocol used by the community. An availability study of cooperative navigation as proposed in the paper around representative US airports was performed. Availabilities between 70-100\% were common at major airports like LGA and MSP in a 30 nmi radius around the airport during morning to evening hours.},

Estimation of Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) parameters is a mature field, with state augmentation being a strong favorite for practical implementation, to the potential detriment of other approaches. A simple modification of the standard state augmentation technique for determining IMU location is presented that determines which model of an enumerated set best fits the measurements of this IMU. A neural network is also trained on batches of IMU and GNSS data to identify the lever arm of the IMU. A comparison of these techniques is performed and it is demonstrated on simulated data that state augmentation outperforms these other methods.},

  abstract = {Pseudorange measurements collected with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers are known to exhibit systematic offsets related to delays in the analogue or digital part of the overall signal generation, transmission and processing chain. In a multi-GNSS context, measurements obtained from different signals, frequencies and constellations need to be processed along with each other and a proper consideration of biases becomes mandatory for a consistent modeling of all observations. The present report discusses code biases in multi-GNSS measurements from first principles and presents a consistent framework for their consideration in multi-GNSS data analysis. Other than with legacy GPS signals, the wide range of GNSS signals today results in an inflationary number of differential code biases (DCBs) that may need to be considered in practical multi-GNSS work. An efficient algorithm is proposed to obtain DCBs for arbitrary signal pairs from a self-consistent, minimal set of reference DCBs. Even though no standard set of DCBs for multi-GNSS work has yet emerged, the proposed algorithm can be used as a basis for future DCB products prepared by and for the geodetic community.},

  abstract = {As the need for robust position, velocity, and timing (PVT) data grows across different industries, signal of opportunity (SOOP) navigation has arisen as a promising source of PVT measurements in addition to traditional GNSSs. The accuracy of PVT estimates delivered by many SOOP navigation schemes, however, is unacceptably poor. Collaborative navigation techniques can improve the performance of such systems by fusing information across multiple navigation receivers. In this work, the inverse covariance intersection (ICI) data fusion algorithm is applied to a group of collaborating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The UAVs are navigating using only Doppler measurements from SOOPs derived from low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, and are are collaborating using peer-to-peer (P2P) ranges derived from two-way time of flight (TW-ToF) measurements. An analysis of the positioning accuracy of the navigators is conducted, which compares a control group of UAVs using no collaborative navigation techniques to a selection of well-known collaborative navigation schemes, as well as a proposed scheme utilizing ICI. This comparison relies on a measurement-level simulation framework, which generates inertial measurements, SOOP range rates, and P2P ranges which can be supplied to each different navigator configuration to create a Monte Carlo test suite. The results of these tests allow for an analysis of the positioning accuracy of each method, as well as the accuracy of each navigator’s own covariance estimate in each case.},

Signal scattering by trees can interfere with GNSS signal reception and can cause navigation loss within and adjacent to woodlands. An estimate of the signal loss vs. foliage depth is needed to quantify navigational degradation by trees at low altitudes. A previous report described a method which attempts to quantify satellite signal degradation caused by foliage by comparing carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N0) to foliage depth along geometric rays cast from the receiver location to the orbital position of GNSS satellites through a 3D matrix of terrain data. A characteristic curve of attenuation vs. foliage depth was found for both L1 and L2 signals at a single forested site. The current study replicates this result at three additional sites, describes refinements to the method, and explores inherent uncertainties that arise from radiofrequency fading and from receiver limitations for weak signals. For the sites surveyed, 60\% and 90\% of navigational signal is lost at 10m and 20m of foliage depth, respectively. Since this technique uses low-cost hardware and readily available data collection software, it can allow aviators to estimate GNSS position fidelity in flight ranges near trees.},

  abstract = {Advances in planetary robotics have led to wheeled robots that have beamed back invaluable science data from the surface of the Moon and Mars. However, these large wheeled robots are unable to access rugged environments such as cliffs, canyons and crater walls that contain exposed rock-faces and are geological time-capsules into the early Moon and Mars. We have proposed the SphereX robot with a mass of 3 kg, 30 cm diameter that can hop, roll and fly short distances. A single robot may slip and fall, however, a multirobot system can work cooperatively by being interlinked using spring-tethers and work much like a team of mountaineers to systematically climb a slope. We consider a team of four or more robots that are interlinked with tethers in an “x” configuration. Each robot secures itself to a slope using spiny gripping actuators, and one by one each robot moves upwards by crawling, rolling or hopping up the slope. Apart from climbing, path planning, and navigation is another critical challenge that needs to be solved to make the whole approach feasible. For climbing navigation, a multirobot system needs to have up to date info of its location, together with a macroscopic map of the climbing surface and a detailed map ahead. This system with limited sensor range needs to discern and identify feasible pathways to make the next climbing step much like a human mountaineer. These climbing pathways consist of a series of anchor points for the robot to grip onto next. Identifying one or more feasible pathways is a critical challenge as the terrain ahead needs to be acquired, followed by identification and ranking of anchor points to grip. The climbing task resembles a maze with wrong pathways leading to dead-end. The multirobot systems need to autonomously explore climbing pathways and know when to give up. In this paper, we present a human devised autonomous climbing algorithm and evaluate it using a high-fidelity dynamics simulator. The climbing surfaces contain impassable obstacles and some loosely held rocks that can dislodge. Under these conditions, the robots need to autonomously map, plan and navigate up or down these steep environments. Autonomous mapping and navigation capability is evaluated using simulated lasers, vision sensors. The human devised planning algorithm uses a new algorithm called bounded-leg A*. Our early simulation results show much promise in these techniques and our future plans include demonstration on real robots in a controlled laboratory environment and outdoors in the canyons of Arizona.},

While navigating, AV-mounted receivers draw pseudorange measurements on ambient unknown terrestrial SOPs and collaboratively estimate the SOPs’ states. After some time, GNSS signals become unavailable, at which point the AVs use the SOPs to aid their INSs in a CoRSLAM framework. Two information fusion strategies are studied: (i) sharing time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements from SOPs and (ii) sharing time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurements taken with reference to an SOP.

  abstract = {Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite propagation models are studied and compared for use in an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based simultaneous tracking and navigation (STAN) framework. Three propagation models are compared: Simplified General Perturbation 4 (SGP4), two-body, and two-body with the second gravitational zonal coefficient J2. Each model is evaluated by studying its open-loop propagation error. The purpose of the evaluation is to select a model with small open-loop propagation error and low model complexity. The two-body with J2 model is selected to possess a good tradeoff between propagation error and model complexity. Experimental results are presented demonstrating an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flying for 160 seconds, the last 45 seconds of which are without GNSS signals. Three navigation frameworks are compared: (i) a GNSS-aided inertial navigation system (INS), and a LEO-aided INS STAN with two Orbcomm LEO satellites utilizing the two-body model (ii) without J2 and (iii) with J2. It is shown that the 3-D position RMSE and final position errors with the unaided INS are 73.1 m and 162.6 m, respectively; the 3-D position RMSE and final position errors with the LEO-aided INS STAN without J2 are 13.4 m and 26.1 m, respectively; and 3-D position RMSE and final position errors with the LEO-aided INS STAN with J2 are 5.3 m and 5.4 m, respectively.},

  abstract = {An opportunistic navigation framework using low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites is analyzed. This framework, termed simultaneous tracking and navigation (STAN), estimates a navigating vehicle’s state along with the states of orbiting LEO satellites. STAN employs an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to fuse measurements from satellite receivers and an inertial navigation system (INS). The navigation performance is analyzed due to: (i) the vehicle being equipped with (1) different inertial measurement unit (IMU) grades: consumer, industrial, and tactical and (2) different receiver clock quality: temperature-compensated crystal oscillators (TCXO) and oven-controlled crystal oscillators (OCXO) and (ii) the LEO satellites being equipped with different transmitter clock quality: OCXO and chip-scale atomic clock (CSAC). Additionally, the effect of utilizing a large number of LEO satellites for navigation is investigated. This analysis provides insight into the achievable performance of STAN, which can serve as an alternative navigation system in global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-denied environments. The performance predictions from simulations are compared with experimental results with real signals from the Orbcomm LEO constellation. A close match between the simulation and experimental results is demonstrated for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigating via the STAN framework with signals from two Orbcomm LEO satellites for 160 seconds, the last 35 seconds of which are without GNSS signals. The UAV’s position root-mean squared error (RMSE) from simulations was 8.6 m, while the experimental position RMSE was 10 m.},

  abstract = {LEO satellite-based navigation has gained attention in recent years. However, there has been very little study on the ionospheric effects for signals transmitted from LEO satellites. In this paper, we present simulation studies of the impact of ionospheric plasma irregularities on L-band signals propagating from a LEO satellite to a receiver on the surface of the Earth. We utilize a physics-based and data-consistent GNSS scintillation signal simulator developed by the authors to generate a phase screen model. The parameters of the phase screen model are extracted from ground-based GNSS receiver measurements of scintillation signals transmitted from real GNSS satellites in MEO orbit. Once the phase screen model is established, we simulate LEO satellite orbits from which GNSS-like signals are transmitted and propagated through the phase screen to reach receivers on the Earth surface. Several different configurations of phase screen and LEO satellite orbits and different scintillation severity levels defined by the MEO satellite signal will be simulated. For each pair of the phase screen and LEO satellite configuration and for each scintillation intensity level, we compute the LEO satellite signal amplitude, carrier phase, and phase rate time series as well as scintillation index and de-correlation time observed by a ground-based receiver. The result will provide a quantitative assessment on the ionospheric irregularities effects on LEO satellite transmissions and offer insights toward developing mitigation techniques for future receivers.},

All events occurred during geomagnetic storms. The storm’s Dst ranged between -204 nT and -51 nT, with a median of -131 nT, and median Kp 7-. We discuss some individual events in more detail.},

  abstract = {A method for detecting targets for autonomous approaches to buildings of micro aerial vehicles is presented. The selected target is a window marked in a reference image which was recorded from a different perspective. We propose a wide baseline matching algorithm based on ORB feature points that offers high accuracy and low processing time. By applying projective transformations to the reference image, invariance to out-of-plane perspective transformations is achieved. Robustness of the homography estimation is improved by filtering keypoint orientation and applying a descriptor ratio test. Moreover, a rating for the estimated homography matrices based on cross correlation values and a color descriptor is introduced. This rating allows for an accurate and robust selection of the correct homography estimate. Since not only pairs of images but image sequences are available for an autonomous approach to buildings, tracking is included in the algorithm. In order to avoid divergence, a re-initialization procedure is presented. The algorithm achieves a high detection rate and good invariance to large perspective changes while meeting real-time computation requirements.},

  abstract = {In hostile environments, GNSS is a potentially unreliable solution for self-localization and navigation. Many systems only use an IMU as a backup system, resulting in integration errors which can dramatically increase during mission execution. We suggest using a fighter radar to illuminate satellites with known trajectories to enhance the self-localization information. This technique is time-consuming and resource-demanding but necessary as other tasks depend on the self-localization accuracy. Therefore an adaption of classical resource management frameworks is required. We propose a quality of service based resource manager with capabilities to account for inter-task dependencies to optimize the self-localization update strategy. Our results show that this leads to adaptive navigation update strategies, mastering the trade-off between self-localization and the requirements of other tasks.},

The main idea is to represent the signal as multiple 2D data grids forming images in the time-frequency domain. The images are then processed by the convolutional layers to extract relevant features. As labelled multipath data are very scarce, we have also developed a synthetic correlator output generator with several tuning strategies for the multipath scenario based on doppler shift, propagation delay and phase estimation errors. In order to assess the overall performance of the technique and validate the possibility to embed it in GNSS receivers, after training with synthetic data, the prediction model has been implemented on a low power vision processing unit (VPU) in the form of a USB dongle which is characterized by a low power consumption envelope in the order of 1W. The results have shown that the model can detect multipath with good accuracy at a faster rate than GNSS receivers sample processing rate on tracking stage.},

  abstract = {We propose a new precise point positioning (PPP) method for a real-time low earth orbit (LEO) satellite positioning problem. Our approach uses the GPS navigation (GPS NAV) solution onboard a satellite as a satellite reference trajectory and estimates the position errors in real-time using the PPP technique. The dynamics of the errors is modeled by the first-order Gauss-Markov process and the GPS ionosphere-free carrier phase measurement model is sequentially linearized around the positions of the GPS NAV. The continuous-discrete Kalman filter is applied to the problem of interest for the state estimation. The advantage of our approach is that the calculation cost is much less demanding compared with approaches that integrate the satellite precise equation of motion. Moreover, as the accuracy of the GPS NAV improves, the accuracy of the proposed method also increases and we expect that happens after the full operation of the GPS III. The experimental evaluation using the Japanese ALOS2 (Advanced Land Observing Satellite), which is a LEO radar earth observation satellite, showed the effectiveness of our approach: 60 to 80 centimeters accuracy improvement on average over that for the GPS NAV whose accuracy was about 2 meters.},

  abstract = {One of the challenging problems for the precise point positioning (PPP) is the reduction of the convergence time (CT). When the CT is defined as the time that the filter reaches a horizontal accuracy of 10 centimeters, the CT is usually about 30 minutes using the GPS satellites. The reason for this relatively long CT comes from the fact that the filter starts from the single point positioning (SPP) result, which is a meter-level, and that it is necessary for the filter to estimate many unknown parameters such as tropospheric delay and carrier phase ambiguities in addition to the receiver position and clock bias. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the iterative scalar observation update on shortening the CT. We propose the iterative scalar observation filtering based on the Joseph form (JF) of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and show that the CT reduction can be achieved in the static PPP experiments using actual GPS carrier phases and precise ephemerides. Compared with the vector observation update of the standard EKF whose average CT was about 28 minutes, about 3-minute reduction was confirmed by using the proposed filter. We also confirmed that the proposed exception handling based on the normalized prediction residual was significant in reducing the CT. According to our experimental evaluation results, the probabilities of the convergence less than 20 and 30 minutes were about 50\% and 75\%, respectively, and the longest CT was about 2 hours.},

  abstract = {NASA aims to bring astronauts to the moon by 2024. According to their lunar exploration program called the Artemis, the spacecraft Orion will be launched by the Space Launch System (SLS) and the Orion will bring astronauts to the moon. Then, they will land on the moon by using the human landing systems (HLS) docked to the Orion or by using the HLS docked to the lunar gateway orbiting around the moon whose components will be launched in 2023. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) is one of the international cooperation partners for this magnificent program. Although there are many technical challenges that should be addressed for accomplishing the lunar exploration mission, one of the key issues is the navigation of the Orion and of the supply spacecrafts to the gateway. Since the Orion will fly far beyond the GPS satellites, it will only receive signals coming from those GPS satellites located at the opposite side of the earth and the number of the available GPS satellites will become small. Moreover, the weaker GPS signals will enhance the measurements noises that corrupt the quality of the pseudo range and carrier phase. Following this background, this paper investigates the achievable navigation accuracy using the GPS carrier phases for the moon transfer orbit (MTO) through a series of simulation using actual ephemerides of the GPS satellites, moon, and sun. Starting from the altitude of about 180 kilometers, direct MTO, GPS pseudo ranges, and carrier phases are simulated. Then, the MTO navigation accuracy using the pseudo ranges or the carrier phases was evaluated. According to our simulation results, the navigation using the carrier phases was significantly more accurate than that using the pseudo ranges. The confirmed position estimation errors were below 100 meters until the altitude of about 200, 000 kilometers and below 180 until the moon altitude. The velocity estimation errors were about 1 cm/s until the altitude of about 200, 000 kilometers and became 5 mm/s after about 280, 000 kilometers.},

The GBAS architecture candidate builds off the work done over the last 10 years by the Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research (SESAR) program. However, the proposed alternative architecture is designed to enable more optimal airborne processing that is expected to enable better performance (e.g. higher accuracy and smaller alert limits), increased robustness to loss of civil GNSS signals on either L1/E1 or L5/E5a frequency as well as to the loss of a constellation, and higher availability for DFMC GBAS globally. The alternative architecture is envisioned to support one or more new levels of GBAS approach service. This GBAS Approach Service Type (GAST) will be referred to generically as GAST X in this paper. GAST X is envisioned as a natural extension of the currently defined GAST C and GAST D. The proposal borrows heavily in many respects from the SESAR proposal for DFMC GBAS documented in reference [1]. However, some of the processing has been reallocated to the airborne equipment in order to enable some very desirable capabilities.},

These estimates typically suffer from communication or processing time delays, which can render an otherwise stable control system unstable. Such effects must therefore be considered during the design process of the cooperative landing controller. In this letter the application of a model-free passivity-based stabilizing controller is proposed, which is based on the monitoring of energy flows in the system, and actively dissipating any given active energy by means of adaptive damping elements. In doing so, overall system passivity and consequently stability is enforced in a straightforward and easy to implement way. The proposed control system is validated in numerical simulations for round trip delays of up to 4 seconds.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the design and testing of an innovative approach to the navigation of fixed wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) using a Vehicle Dynamic Model (VDM) based, tightly coupled INS/GNSS architecture. The investigation focuses on lowmass (sub 30 kg) and low cost (sub \$12,000) applications. Using control inputs from the autopilot combined with knowledge of the vehicle dynamics, an error state extended kalman filter is used to fuse raw GNSS observables and Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) grade Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements to provide improved navigation performance in periods that would otherwise be classified as outages in a loosely coupled sense. IMU biases, wind velocity errors and VDM parameter errors are estimated in the filter alongside timing, position, velocity and orientation parameters. Monte Carlo simulations reveal a modest degrading performance with decreased number of satellites in view when using the VDM as opposed to rapid drift in a conventional INS/GNSS approach. A comparison to a typical VDM-based approach operating in a loosely coupled architecture is also made. The proposed VDM/INS/GNSS tightly coupled architecture has been found to offer improved navigation performance with more than 45\% improvement in position error with 3 satellites in view as opposed to a loosely coupled VDM/INS/GNSS architecture during a GNSS outage. The estimation error in yaw is improved by 16\% with the proposed architecture with 3 satellites as opposed to a VDM scheme operating in a loosely coupled architecture for an outage period lasting 140 seconds. The proposed model-based integration approach using raw GNSS observables is seen to offer improved navigation performance with minimal cost and weight penalty, this approach seems to be a promising method for low cost applications.},

  abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) have been undergoing major changes recently. While old constellations are getting modernized, new ones are being completed. These developments mean that more satellites than ever are in orbit and broadcasting GNSS signals. This ever-increasing number of satellites is naturally having major effects on the positioning performance of the Precise Point Positioning (PPP) measurement processing technique. Indeed, while PPP suffers from relatively long initial convergence times, it has been proved that making use of as many signals as possible helps in decreasing this PPP convergence time. On the other hand, Ambiguity Resolution (AR) has also proved to be very effective in reducing convergence time, especially when combined with multiple constellations and multiple frequencies. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the importance of AR in the current multi-GNSS context and vice versa using static, geodetic receiver measurements. At first, the effect of the number of used constellations and AR on the PPP performance is investigated. The results indicate that fixing ambiguities with fewer constellations can be more beneficial than processing more constellations without any AR. For instance, a typical fixed GPS + float GLONASS solution converges in 9.5 minutes compared to 11.5 minutes for a typical float GPS + GLONASS + Galileo + BeiDou solution. These results illustrate that AR is still relevant even with the myriad of satellites currently in orbit. The next step in the paper analyzes the relationship between the number of satellites and multi-GNSS float and fixed solutions through the simulation of obstructions. Results show an exponential decay in the convergence time as the number of satellites increases for both float and fixed solutions, following the law of diminishing returns, meaning that ever-increasing the number of satellites is not the answer to improving the PPP performance. In that case, AR is a good alternative to further reduce the PPP convergence time, as the fixed solution results in reduced (40\% to 50\%) convergence times for all the tested average number of processed satellites. Results also show that even with a 30° elevation mask, a multi-GNSS PPP-AR solution can be comparable and have an even shorter convergence time (17\%) than a float multi-GNSS solution without any obstructions – despite the full float solution using more than 9 additional satellites compared to the obstructed solution.},

  abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Precise Point Positioning (PPP) processing has been subject to much research in recent years, and the technique has shown potential as an alternative or replacement for Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) processing. Indeed, RTK (and network RTK) is known for being able to reach cm-level positions instantaneously, or within a few seconds, primarily depending on the length of the baseline. However, local reference stations are required for measurement differencing to eliminate error sources, which is a limitation in areas where such infrastructure is not available or costly. PPP on the other hand does not need local stations, and only requires global satellite corrections to achieve high precision positions. This work reaches for RTK levels of performance without the need for local information or infrastructure through PPP. Conventional PPP is a measurement-dependent technique requiring tens of minutes to reach centimetre-level positions. Luckily, given the recent advances in GNSS with many constellations broadcasting on two, three, or four frequencies, this work makes use of the signals currently available by processing signals from GPS, Galileo, BeiDou-2/3, and GLONASS and fixing ambiguities for the first four constellations, on as many frequencies as available. This processing is done through a four-frequency, five-constellation uncombined Decoupled Clock Model (DCM) that has been expanded as part of this work, and the results are tested on 1448 datasets from stations spread around the world. Results show that sub-decimetre positioning can be achieved instantaneously at 2σ and 1σ. Compared to RTK, the proposed algorithm is able to reach instantaneous convergence of 2.5 cm for 81\% of stations, and within one minute for 89\% of stations, showing that PPP can indeed consistently reach centimetre-level positions quasiinstantaneously. These results are reinforced when performing epoch-by-epoch processing without use of a priori information, as an average of approximately 80\% of all epochs from 27 stations processed over one week converge below 2.5 cm in a single epoch at 1σ, as opposed to less than 0.5\% for a classic PPP solution. These results demonstrate that consistent RTK-like quality can be achieved with PPP processing without the need for local infrastructure or corrections, opening the door for truly global precise positioning.},

In this contribution, we analyse the performance of a novel integrated navigation method for array-aided relative positioning and attitude determination using real data. We consider two platforms equipped with multiple GNSS receivers/antennas. Precise GNSS positioning and attitude determination rely on successful resolution of the carrier phase integer ambiguities. The Multivariate Constrained-Least squares AMBiguity Decorrelation Adjustment (MC-LAMBDA) method is used to reliably resolve platform ambiguities making use of the knowledge of antenna geometry in the local body frame. This reliable platform processing consequently enhances the between-platform ambiguity resolution and baseline estimation. Using real data, we demonstrate that this method not only enhances the attitude determination but also improves the between-platform ambiguity resolution and the between-platform baseline estimates. Our study includes performance analyses of the array-aided positioning method in terms of number of antennas per platform, number of frequencies, and multi-GNSS vs a single system.},

  abstract = {Driverless vehicles must operate with a safety integrity level, but urban environments degrade GNSS navigation accuracy and thereby fault-free integrity. Integration with INS helps maintain continuity, but position errors drift over time without GNSS signals. Whether modern navigation systems can provide satisfactory integrity for driverless vehicles throughout a city is still undetermined. This research investigates how GNSS and INS, when appropriately augmented by LiDAR ranging from local landmarks, can safely navigate vehicles through a real-world urban environment. We begin by defining safety requirements for driverless vehicles under fault-free conditions and developing measurement models for multi-sensor integrated navigation systems using an EKF. The critical elements of urban navigation are then discussed, including individual INS noise parameter specifications and the effect of velocity updates. Simulations along a nine-kilometer-long urban transect in downtown Chicago show that velocity updates can extend navigation continuity by bridging intermittent GNSS signal availability. However, position reference updates at 35-meter intervals, in our case LiDAR ranges from local landmarks, are needed to achieve 100\% navigation availability through the transect.},

To protect against all possible ionospheric anomalies, the system assumes that the worst-case undetected ionosphere-induced differential errors might affect users. The hypothetical impact of ionospheric anomalies can be lowered by improving monitoring capability, and one possible improvement not studied previously is to utilize two-way transmissions from the multiple networked UAVs supported by LADGNSS at any given time. Two-way datalinks are already part of the LADGNSS architecture to support UAV status reports and cooperative guidance, and they can be exploited to allow all UAVs connected to LADGNSS ground stations to share the threat information collected by any of them.},

  abstract = {Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) is a critical capability that has become indispensable to the United States military, government services, and the commercial sector. This paper presents a method for distributed localization in Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) without GPS. Traditional INS incur integration drift error over operationally relevant times scales, but this drift can be reduced by using a nonlinear filter to compute the joint state p(x|z) of all agents in the network subject to range measurements z between pairs of agents. The goal of this work is to increase the localization accuracy of each agent’s position, velocity, and orientation. To compute the joint state, which includes cross correlations between agents, agents share their inertial measurement unit (IMU) measurements and exchange range measurements at some specified frequency. Tracking the cross correlations between agents allows full utilization of the range measurements via a nonlinear filter, which allows flexibility regarding each agent’s sensor configuration and any additional sensor inputs. In this paper we formulate this method, demonstrate its effectiveness with simulations that use hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) IMU and range measurements, and investigate the effect of dropped IMU and range measurements on final localization accuracy. Our results show that errors incurred by dropped IMU measurements can be ameliorated by inflating the process noise covariance matrix, and that up to 90\% of range messages can be dropped without degrading performance with respect to a baseline. Finally, we also present network communication analyses for IMU measurement broadcasts and range messages. The HWIL data used in these simulations was collected during field experiments conducted by Raytheon BBN Technologies.},

  abstract = {Global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) are a vital technology for many applications. The received signals, however, are weak and easily vulnerable to intentional/unintentional interference. Jamming signals are becoming a serious threat for GNSS users and the localization of the jammer is an effective countermeasure to such attacks. Congested areas are particularly sensitive to these kinds of attacks, but they also present an opportunity to leverage crowdsourced data for threat monitoring purposes. In this context, we foresee a system where agents navigate an area with the ability to transmit the measured signal power, information that can be leveraged for jamming localization purposes. We propose a crowdsourced-based scheme for jammer localization, based on a signal propagation model, enhanced through the use of physics-based path loss modeling and an augmented, data-driven, component. This method can outperform the maximum likelihood estimator in a realistic scenario, despite the limited knowledge of the propagation model. The disruptive effect on agents’ own position estimation affects the final jammer localization outcome, which is evaluated in this paper. In the work, we provide extensive experimentation to measure the effect of denied or degraded positioning on crowdsourced estimation as a function of relevant parameters such as agents’ positioning error, observation density, and measurement noise.},

  abstract = {Observation and characterization of GNSS signals in space are gaining momentum for the re-use of GNSS and its integration in Orbit Determination and Time Synchronization solutions, oriented towards more autonomous Guidance, Navigation, and Control systems. In the initial phase of this transient, Radio-Frequency signals observations from space-borne receivers allow supporting GNSS-based space navigation thanks the remote post-processing. This contributes to understand and compensate for unmodelled features of GNSS signals propagating at large distances, up to the Moon’s surface. Such activities require the capture of Intermediate Frequency (IF) signal samples, and upcoming Lunar missions, such as the NASA/ASI Lunar GNSS Receiver Experiment (LuGRE) scientific payload, are going to support the collection of raw GNSS signal samples and the transmission of such data to the mission ground segment. The size of such data is the main bottleneck for the typical, narrowband communication channels dedicated to such payloads. Therefore a sufficient amount of signal samples must be defined for an effective post-processing at the ground segment. As an early investigation, this work sets as a minimum objective the acquisition of GPS signals at the low carrier-to-noise density ratio (C/N0) throughout a sample Moon Transfer Orbit (MTO).},

This paper presents the results obtained for two promising GNSS applications: the prediction of ionospheric maps for the correction of the related error on the pseudorange measurement; and the forecast of fast corrections normally present in the EGNOS messages, in case the latter are missing. Results show how, based on the historical data and the time correlation of the values, machine learning methods outperformed simple regression algorithms, improving the positioning performance at GNSS user level. The work results also confirmed the validity of this approach for the automatic detection of outliers due to ionospheric scintillation phenomena.},

However, it requires the network infrastructure (anchors) to be synchronized, preferably with subnanosecond accuracy. Herein, an approach for synchronizing multiple anchors in a wireless, line-of-sight manner is described. This method is able to deal with UWB modules equipped with inexpensive drift-prone oscillators, as such impairments are estimated and compensated. By applying the proposed approach the influence of generally variable environment (e.g. temperature) on timing and positioning performance is reduced. Moreover, the presented algorithm is suitable for straightforward chaining of the line-of sight-segments in order to allow synchronization of distant anchors that cannot be synchronized with the master anchor directly.},

  abstract = {Vehicle positioning and tracking is a key component of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Cooperative positioning techniques through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) or vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) information sharing can improve the existing proprioceptive based positioning systems such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) which are prone to errors due to urban canyons, signal jamming, etc. V2Vbased positioning might not fulfill all positioning needs, given the low Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) penetration in today’s traffic. In these scenarios, infrastructure sensors can assist the vehicles in estimating the state of the traffic through I2V communication. The state estimation requires fusion between the infrastructure and the on-board sensor measurements which are often multi-rate and asynchronous in nature. Moreover, the measurements from the infrastructure might be delayed and not time-synchronized with other sensors. Hence, it is imperative to address the practical problems while designing a sensor fusion framework for fusing multiple sensor measurements in a real world scenario. This paper aims at evaluating the improvement in vehicle tracking by fusing roadside LiDAR measurements with the on-board GPS position measurements. Various motion models for the vehicle are studied and implemented with a sequential Kalman filter for estimating the vehicle states.},

  abstract = {GNSS/INS integration systems are increasingly used in the navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. To decrease the size and weight, single antenna GNSS is usually favorable in many UAV applications. To reach optimal accuracy, the system should be initialized properly. However, a single antenna GNSS/INS system cannot directly measure the initial heading of the UAV, without additional sensors such as a magnetometer or gyrocompass. Course over ground computation is also not feasible for vehicles like multirotors where the direction of motion is not aligned to the vehicle body axis. This paper proposes a new real-time approach for initial attitude estimation of a multirotor using a single-antenna GNSS and a MEMS IMU. An array of strapdown navigators with random initial headings are spread in the environment and after a short period with sufficient motion, the best-fit navigator is determined and its attitude states are used to initialize the GNSS/INS fusion filter. This approach provides accurate initial attitude angles in a few tens of seconds, which is important due to the limited operational time of small UAVs. In addition, the proposed approach does not require a complicated process to be performed by the user at the UAV start-up, i.e., any dynamic motion during the alignment phase is sufficient to reach the proper heading accuracy. Since this is a purely algorithmic approach, it does not require any additional sensor.},

  abstract = {Today, nearly every smartphone can provide a network location alongside the traditional method of using the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). The Android location engine is made up of two primary location providers: the GPS Location Provider (GLP), and the Network Location Provider (NLP). The recommended location service in Android is the Fused Location Provider (FLP), a location application interface (API) from Google which combines information from the GLP and NLP. The FLP is intended to be the ultimate positioning solution in Android, but it has been observed that in instances of GNSS spoofing, the FLP will trust the spoofed signals even in cases where the NLP provides a reliable estimate for the position of the device. In this paper, we describe the methods of the NLP, which include Wi-Fi fingerprinting, or scanning for visible Wi-Fi access points to build a radio map that can be used by devices to provide an estimated location. Furthermore, we test the accuracy of the NLP in the following scenarios: indoor, residential, urban, and canyon. Also, when available, we compare the NLP location to truth in order to assess the potential of the NLP in providing a reliable positioning solution and detecting the presence of GNSS spoofing. In addition, a correlation analysis between the accuracy of the NLP and the number of available Wi-Fi access points is carried out. This study is an assessment of the current accuracy and performance of NLP in Android devices. However, it is important to note that the performance of the NLP will only improve with the advent of 5G technology and Wi-Fi RTT Ranging. The growing network positioning infrastructure combined with the widespread availability of Wi-Fi access points will render the NLP more relevant than ever. The assessed accuracy of the NLP provides a deeper insight into its potential to aid in the detection and mitigation of GNSS spoofing.},

  abstract = {A receiver architecture is proposed to jointly detect and track unknown beacons to extract navigation observables from fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) signals of opportunity and beyond. Unlike conventional opportunistic receivers which require knowledge of the signal structure, particularly the reference signals (RSs), the proposed receiver requires knowledge of only the RS period and carrier frequency of the signal. The transmitted RSs for private networks are unknown for an opportunistic receiver. Moreover, to use the spectrum more efficiently, some of these RSs are only transmitted on demand in 5G NR, which limits the existing opportunistic navigation frameworks to signals which are on always-on; hence, limiting the exploitable RS bandwidth. To exploit the full available bandwidth and improve ranging accuracy, the proposed receiver is designed to estimate all the RSs contained in the transmitted signals corresponding to multiple unknown sources. Navigation observables (pseudorange and carrier phase) are subsequently derived from the estimated RSs. The proposed receiver operates in two stages: (i) detection of unknown signals and (ii) tracking. The detection of unknown signals is modeled as a sequential detection problem where the number of sources and their corresponding RSs and Doppler frequencies are unknown. The generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) test for sequentially detecting active gNBs is used to estimate the number of sources and their RSs. In order for the receiver to refine and maintain the Doppler and RS estimates provided by the acquisition stage, tracking loops are used. The output of the tracking loops, namely carrier phase and code phase, are then used to estimate the receiver’s position. Experimental results are presented demonstrating the capabilities of the proposed receiver with real 5G signals on ground and aerial platforms, with an experiment showing the navigation results with real 5G signals on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigating using the proposed receiver over a 416 m trajectory with a position root mean-squared error (RMSE) of 4.35 m.},

Although signatures in dynamics for cars are not as strong as they are in aircraft, there is agreement between both sources of measurement. The statistical methods previously used, however, are not yet robust to factors in the automobile environment contributing to false alarms. A method focused on the frequency content using wavelet coherence is introduced that has the potential to greatly simplify the operations necessary to compare acceleration signatures.},

  author = {Nematallah, H and Korenberg, M and Noureldin, A and Atia, M M},
  abstract = {In vision-aided INS/GNSS integrated navigation systems, several errors contribute to significant drifts in the absence of GNSS and during severe GNSS interruptions. These errors includes cameras distortion, camera calibration, camera misalignments, and feature extraction/tracking errors. In addition, inertial sensors biases, drifts, nonorthogonality, non-normality and misalignment also significantly affect the dead-reckoning navigation accuracy in the absence of GNSS. Due to the complex nonlinearity inherent in these errors, this paper introduces a double-filter mechanism enhanced by nonlinear error modeling for multi-sensor vision-aided integrated navigation systems for land vehicles. The proposed system integrates GNSS, vision, INS, and odometry. The proposed methodology tries to reduce the effects of nonlinear errors that propagate through different components of the integrated navigation system. The proposed methodology can work in real-time due to the utilization of a fast orthogonal search (FOS) approach as the nonlinear modeling technique. The paper verifies the operational performance of the proposed system using a physical experimental setup and real-road experimental data. Initial results shows remarkable positional and heading accuracy improvements if FOS training is properly performed.},

By tracking extracted lines features, the relative 2D orientation/translation motions are estimated. The proposed methodology was applied on an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to estimate its 2D relative orientation/translational motion. The estimated LiDAR-based relative orientation/translational changes are fused with Inertial/Odometer measurements by an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).

  abstract = {One of the major challenges in the design of high accuracy, high integrity localization procedures for rail applications based on Global Navigation Satellite Systems is represented by the local hazards that cannot be mitigated by resorting to augmentation networks. By fact, combining smoothed code pseudoranges with (differential) carrier phase and/or with Inertial Measurement Unit’s outputs is ineffective against multipath low frequency components. These issues can be mitigated by processing images, depth maps and/or pointclouds provided by imaging sensors placed on board. The absolute position of the train can be determined by combining its relative position with respect to georeferenced rail infrastructure elements (e.g., panels, signals, signal gantries) provided by the visual localization processing unit with the landmark absolute position. In addition, the visual input can be exploited for determining on which track the train is located and can be used as complementary odometry source. Moreover, the information provided by the visual localization processing unit can be used to monitor integrity and compute the protection levels. In this contribution we present a localization system that integrates a Global Navigation Satellite System receiver, Inertial Measurement Units, and video sensors (such as monocular and stereo video camera, Time of Flight camera and LIDAR), and has the potential to overcome some of the operational and economical limitations of the current train localization system employed in the European Railway Traffic Management System.},

  author = {Neri, A and Rispoli, F and Salvatori, P and Vegni, A M},
  abstract = {Nowadays, the train integrity function is assured by track circuits deployed along the line. This approach is safe but has several limitations since if any part of a track is occupied, that entire track circuit must be assumed as occupied and if the track circuits are made shorter to increase the traffic capacity, additional costs are incurred. In the European Rail Track Management System (ERTMS-ETCS) Level 3 trains must be able to localize and to monitor their integrity by themselves without the track circuits. This scenario makes it possible to optimize the capacity of the lines and to further reduce the operational costs by eliminating most of the track circuits.. . In this paper, we investigate the capability of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) to perform the integrity function in the perspective of the deployment of the ERTMS-ETCS L3 platform. The reference architecture is based on a pair of GNSS train Location Determination Systems (LDS) respectively located at the rear and the front-side of the train and connected each other by a radio link. A novel train integrity estimation solution that exploits a GNSS Double-Difference approach, has been developed for its advantages to mitigate most of the iono, tropo, clocks hazards caused by the GNSS signals. The Protection level and the Hazard Misleading Informations rates are derived by taking into account the safety requirements SIL-4 (Safety Integrity Level 4) of the ERTMS-ETCS system. The simulations have been performed by assuming a 2500 m train length; they confirm the validity of the proposed approach and pave the way for a seamless introduction of the GNSS into the ERTMS-ETCS L3 by replacing the fixed track circuits with virtual track circuits of variable size, and without affecting the safety requirements.},

Technology development impacts our daily life, positioning becomes essential. At meanwhile, urbanization induced the side-effect to position, especially for GNSS. High rise buildings and obstacles can block and reflect the GNSS signals. Using a 3D building model is a new era to aid urban positioning, namely 3D mapping aided (3DMA) GNSS. Conventional 3DMA GNSS uses position hypothesis candidates to estimate the receiver location. Throughout simulation at each distributed candidate, the one with the highest similarity to measurements tends to be the receiver location. Two obvious shortcomings of positioning hypothesis candidate are: first, candidate distribution must cover the truth location to provide satisfactory performance. Second, the computation load is proportional to the number of distributed candidates, and unwanted computation load may be caused during the estimation process. This study tries to overcome these limitations by replacing the positioning hypothesis candidates with nonlinear least squares to estimate the receiver location. Contributions of this study will be reducing the computation load requirement while maintaining the identical positioning performance. We selected shadow matching as the showcase to demonstrate the impacts of our proposed method on the 3DMA GNSS with actual GNSS data from a low-cost receiver.},

  abstract = {The performance of the Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is limited in urban canyons because the signals are reflected over building surfaces. Urban localization can be enhanced using the resources associated with 3D building models. Different 3D mapping aided (3DMA) GNSS algorithms have been proposed, in which the 3D building models are used to aid the positioning. Recently, the candidate-based 3DMA GNSS framework was proposed as a particle filter-based approach. The distributed particles are examined, and the particles that best match the observed measurements, that is, the particles with the minimum cost, are identified as the receiver location. Such particle sampling approaches are inexpensive but incur a high computational load. To decrease the computational load, in this study, the cost function of a 3DMA GNSS is modelled using a Kriging-based interpolation method based on the sample data provided by a set of sparsely distributed particles. The regressed model is used to estimate the receiver state through an iterative nonlinear least-squares method. Moreover, the proposed Kriging-based 3DMA GNSS is integrated with the velocity estimated by Doppler measurements through factor graph optimization (FGO). The optimization process can enhance the 3DMA GNSS positioning accuracy and robustness even when smartphones and commercial-level GNSS receivers are used. The proposed method achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 10 m for most of the designed experiments in Hong Kong urban canyons.},

  abstract = {A lower bound for the error covariance of radio simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with terrestrial signals of opportunity (SOPs) is derived. The following problem is considered. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with an on-board receiver extracts psuedorange measurements from SOP towers with unknown emitter positions and SOP towers with known emitter positions. Each SOP tower contains dynamic, stochastic clock error states (bias and drift). An extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed to fuse the psuedorange measurements to simultaneously localize the UAV and SOP towers, together with estimating the difference between the receiver’s and each SOP’s clock bias and clock drift terms. It is shown that the so-called radio SLAM base case is observable, in which a UAV with imperfect knowledge about its initial states is navigating in an environment containing one unknown SOP tower and two partially known SOP towers (i.e., towers whose position are known, but clock bias and drift states are unknown). A lower bound on the EKF estimation error covariance matrix is derived and demonstrated numerically. Monte Carlo simulation results are presented demonstrating the derived lower bound for a UAV navigating in a radio SLAM fashion without global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) signals. Experimental results are presented for a UAV with an initial estimate of its position making pseudorange measurements to two partially known and one unknown cellular SOP. The UAV achieves a two-dimensional (2-D) position root-mean squared error (RMSE) of 10.76 m over a trajectory of 600 m.},

  abstract = {This paper explores how advancements in computer processing, both in single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) and multicore technology, have shaped the growth of software-defined Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers. Historically, GNSS software-defined radio (SDR) has been limited to research and development purposes. But now, modern processor architectures and instruction sets are particularly efficient, paving the way for more capable SDR. GRID, the GNSS SDR developed in the Radionavigation Lab, has recently achieved a remarkable inflection point: under some processing configurations, the correlation operation, by which each channel’s signal is mixed to baseband and de-spread via multiplication against a local code replica, is no longer the bottleneck process. This important milestone in pure software-defined GNSS makes SDR a formidable competitor against traditional mass-market application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)-based GNSS receivers. Further, this paper offers an exploration of commercial use cases particularly well-suited for GNSS SDR: space-applications, wall-mounted electronic technologies, and automated vehicles. In detailing the status of GRID and its various applications, this paper presents the case that software-defined GNSS is ready for launch for mass market applications, rather than solely a tool for research and development.},

  abstract = {Real-Time Kinematic positioning technique (RTK) is a differential positioning technology that can utilize pseudo-range measurements and carrier phase measurements to provide positioning results with centimeter-level accuracy in real time. However, RTK degenerates in urban areas where Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are reflected and blocked. Positioning results can fluctuate immensely in a GNSS-hostile area. Besides, the carrier phase tracking loop is the weakest link of the GNSS receiver, and the carrier tracking loop is easier to lose lock than the code tracking loop. RTK cannot provide positioning results when satellites with valid carrier phases are less than four. The introduction of supplementary techniques and sensors can cover the shortage of RTK. Differential GNSS (DGNSS) is another differential technique that only utilizes pseudo-range measurements. DGNSS can bridge the RTK outage caused by the absence of carrier phase measurements. A Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity (MARG) sensor and a barometer can help mitigate fluctuations of positioning results. Over past years, smartphones equipped with GNSS chipsets, MARG sensors, and barometers have become commodities and possess the capacity to combine these sensors to provide continuous positioning results in urban areas. This paper designs a continuous positioning algorithm based on differential GNSS techniques, MARG sensors, and barometers with a Xiaomi Mi 8. We carry out several walking tests in urban areas to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of our algorithm. We also develop an Android application called CIGRLogger to collect sensor measurements. Researchers have access to the source code of this application and a version of RTK in C++ at https://github.com/Nronaldo.},

To provide accurate and reliable positioning with a low-cost GNSS/MEMS INS system, it is valuable to introduce specific auxiliary information that can improve the navigation performance and is independent of extra hardware costs. The auxiliary information is especially useful during GNSS outage periods or when the vehicle is moving with low dynamics (e.g. no change of attitude and accelerations) which lead to the poor observability of the GNSS/INS navigation system.

  abstract = {In the urban environment, multipath and non-line of-sight are the critical source of measurement errors and signal power loss. In urban canyons, whilst the user can still acquire the required number of satellites to obtain a position, thanks to multi-constellation GNSS, such signals may be subject to gross multipath errors and lead to a potentially unsafe position. In this paper, machine learning techniques are used to model the multipath error distributions. The set of features which have been assessed are commonly used parameters such as the elevation, S/N, and user speed. For modeling and evaluation of the model validity, a large number of hours of experimental data has been collected by driving a sensor-equipped vehicle in the urban area in Toulouse. Considering the processing of data from single-frequency type GNSS receiver, the multipath error component is extracted from measurement using appropriate techniques (measurement differential, clock bias estimation, etc.). Quantile of multipath error are modeled using neural network-based regression technique with the features. Modeling results using the proposed method are validated by an integrity assessment of the experimental data.},

Providing GNSS integrity for automotive use cases presents several challenges beyond the traditional techniques for integrity in GNSS previously developed by the aviation industry. First, automotive applications demand higher accuracy than aviation, down to lane level in some cases. This requires the use of carrier phase-based positioning methods, in contrast to the pseudorange positioning used in aviation. Secondly, the local environment for automotive applications is different than in aviation, particularly with regards to multipath. Lastly, automotive applications are more cost sensitive and will use mass market chipsets and antennas, which can result in increased measurement noise and poorer multipath rejection than hardware used in other GNSS applications.},

Firstly, the odometer-based method, which are proposed in our previous research [1], is concretized to be implemented for general cases. This method detects faults in the GNSS solution due to satellite failure or local effects using both odometry and track geometry of the onboard system. It enables to monitor all three-dimensional solution error so that higher sensitivity for the fault detection can be achieved. Secondly, single-axis accelerometer-based approach is newly proposed. Positioning architecture of this method is designed in traveling distance domain with the configuration of single-axis accelerometer installed along the forward direction. The diagnosis of GNSS signal can be done easily in one-dimensional space. Therefore, the latter method is expected to give greater sensitivity to detect GNSS failures while maintaining a relatively simple architecture. Both methods are tested in simulation, and their abilities for detecting fault in GNSS signal are investigated and compared.},

Non-aeronautical sources include systems with no ARNS frequency allocation also radiating in the GNSS band, either voluntarily or involuntarily. To precisely estimate the impact of RFI sources on GNSS receiver has one main stake. Indeed, it allows to assess the GNSS receiver capability to meet minimum International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) performance objectives in nominal RFI environment or in nonnominal RFI environment (during jamming operations for instance).},

The positioning algorithm described in this work will be tested and validated with real data recorded during a test drive under typical urban conditions. To assess the positioning performance, the results will be compared to a highly reliable reference sensor. It will be shown that the proposed algorithm autonomously excludes suspicious observations and decreases the positioning error down to 50 percent even when using low-cost single frequency receivers.},

  abstract = {Navigation Message Authentication (NMA) is a technique to protect GNSS navigation messages by cryptographically signing them. Cell phone based GNSS receivers, which account for by far the largest segment of the GNSS market by user numbers, are typically unable to take advantage of NMA due to the their low rate of navigation message decoding. Assisted NMA (ANMA) turns the NMA concept on its head: the cell phone decodes only a subset of the navigation messages, but verifies that the cryptographic signatures in the decoded messages are authentic using an alternative internet-based source of data that provides the required information with some delay. In this paper we present a proof of concept implementation of ANMA, using the Android raw measurements API, the Galileo Open Service NMA (OSNMA) and the Galmon server to obtain the true navigation data. We test the implementation in a number of static and dynamic environments and demonstrate the feasibility of the concept. We also note some gaps that would need to be filled for the ANMA concept to be viable. Most notably the low and unpredictable rate of I/NAV message decoding within the cell phone is something that would need to be addressed.},

In this work we investigate the feasibility of this concept, addressing some of the challenges presented, including: the limitation to only a single constellation; management of aligning the PRS chips with the signal snapshots; and processing a combination of open signals (from standard survey-grade receivers) and PRS signals (from the snapshot tool).

Authentication features have also been considered for other civilian Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals in prior research. This prior work has focused on both data authentication and signal authentication. Whereas data authentication methods primarily aim to protect GNSS signal message content from spoofing threats, signal authentication methods aim to additionally protect the ranging information.},

  abstract = {Conventional TRN algorithm considered Radar Altimeter (RA) measured altitude, the distance to the closest terrain point within the antenna beam width, as the direct relative altitude below the vehicle. The altitude error occurred in this process resulted in TRN errors. To overcome this drawback of the Rader Altimeter, the Interferometric Radar Altimeter (IRA) was developed jointly by Agency for Defense Development (ADD) and Hanwha Systems. With IRA, more complicated calculation is required to determine the precise relative distance of the closest terrain point using the sensor output. In order to calculate the relative distance to the closest terrain point using the output of the IRA in a real flight environment where the influence of the wind exists, a new approach different from the conventional one is necessary. In this paper, the new relative distance calculation method is proposed for that point, and proved mathematically. To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed approach, flight test was executed and analyzed. The flight test result shows that there was a difference between the Euler angles and the effective observation angles obtained by vehicle's velocity due to wind effects. With the wind effect, the zero Doppler line is located at the skewed position from the aircraft lateral axis, and the difference was confirmed between the proposed closest terrain point calculation method and that of the conventional. The accuracy of each relative distance calculation method was evaluated by comparing the altitude of the closest terrain point and terrain DB obtained by LiDAR(Light Detection and Ranging) during flight test. The new method has smaller mean and standard deviation of the altitude error, implying the superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

ProcNet eliminates many of the limitations of the legacy differential processor titled “DDBase” that is currently employed, including rigorously processing dual frequency observations and allowing the use of ANTEX antenna models. ProcNet provides improved robustness and performance as compared to DDBase, particularly when dual frequency observations are used. Initial analysis indicates short baseline precision improvements ranging from 30 to 50\%, with a notable precision increase in the vertical direction. Robustness is improved by employing undifferenced GNSS observations via a rearrangement of the observation equations instead of the traditional approach using double differenced values. ProcNet is part of a new unified processing architecture developed at ARL:UT that provides both Precise Point Positioning and Differential Positioning capabilities. As a result of the new architecture, ProcNet can employ site displacement and measurement models that are traditionally used for Precise Point Positioning solutions to enable better relative solutions for long baselines.},

  abstract = {It is well known that GNSS receivers are vulnerable to jamming and spoofing attacks, and numerous such incidents have been reported in the last decade all over the world. The notion of participatory sensing, or crowdsensing, is that a large ensemble of voluntary contributors provides measurements, rather than relying on a dedicated sensing infrastructure. The participatory sensing network under consideration in this work is based on GNSS receivers embedded in, for example, mobile phones. The provided measurements refer to the receiverreported carrier-to-noise-density ratio (C/N0) estimates or automatic gain control (AGC) values. In this work, we exploit C/N0 measurements to locate a GNSS jammer, using multiple receivers in a crowdsourcing manner. We extend a previous jammer position estimator by only including data that is received during parts of the sensing period where jamming is detected by the sensor. In addition, we perform hardware testing for verification and evaluation of the proposed and compared state-of-the-art algorithms. Evaluations are performed using a Samsung S20+ mobile phone as participatory sensor and a Spirent GSS9000 GNSS simulator to generate GNSS and jamming signals. The proposed algorithm is shown to work well when using C/N0 measurements and outperform the alternative algorithms in the evaluated scenarios, producing a median error of 50 meters when the pathloss exponent is 2. With higher pathloss exponents the error gets higher. The AGC output from the phone was too noisy and needs further processing to be useful for position estimation.},

  abstract = {Bias and scale-factor are the major deterministic error parameters of the inertial sensors and these parameters have to be compensated before integrating sensors to a navigation system as the performance degradation of the sensors is undesirable. The fact is that, deterministic error parameters can dramatically change due to aging. Therefore, aging tests play an important role in determining the life cycle of sensors. Accelerated aging tests are commonly used and most time-efficient method to determine the change in the error parameters. There are generally four types of accelerated aging tests: Temperature Cycling, High-Temperature Operating Life, Temperature Humidity Bias and Vibration. As the aim in this paper is to stress the thermo-mechanical mechanisms in the MEMS sensing units, temperature cycling is used for accelerated aging. Temperature cycling tests are applied to various inertial measurement units in order to simulate 3 years life cycle in a controlled storage environment. Moreover, multi position static and dynamic tests are performed using 2 axis rate table and data is collected from the test units after each 6 months period in cycling in order to analyze the effect of each cycle on the error parameters. Throughout this study the test results, especially the change in the error parameters of the commercial MEMS IMUs in the market caused by temperature cycling corresponding to 3 years controlled storage will be given in detail.},

  abstract = {The ability of different neural networks to mitigate multipath signals for opportunistic navigation with downlink 5G signals is assessed. Two neural networks, namely feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) and time-delay neural networks (TDNNs), are designed to learn multipath-induced errors on a 5G receiver’s code phase estimate. The neural networks use inputs from the autocorrelation function (ACF) to learn the errors in the code phase estimate of a conventional delay-locked loop (DLL). A ray tracing algorithm is used to produce high fidelity training data that could model the dynamics between the line of sight (LOS) component and the non-line of sight (NLOS) components. Cross-validation methods are used on FFNNs to examine the sensitivity of the out-of-sample error on the number of hidden layers, number of neurons per layer, and regularization constant that limits the complexity of the hypothesis space. Moreover, TDNNs with varying access to the time history of the ACF taps are assessed. Experimental results in a multipath-rich environment are presented demonstrating that the proposed TDNN achieved ranging root-mean squared error (RMSE) reduction of 27.1\% compared to a conventional DLL.},

  abstract = {Future evolution of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) scenario is expected to significantly improve the performance of GNSS based navigation systems, in particular accuracy and integrity. However, these systems will still be vulnerable to different threats like interference, jamming, or scintillation, which directly affect the continuity of service. One effective way to mitigate these threats is to integrate GNSS with an Inertial Navigation System (INS). Under the event of a failure a hybrid navigation system limits the degradation of the performance increasing the chances to complete the targeted procedure, especially for procedures that require relatively short time for completion. For this reason the usage of GNSS/INS integrated systems to support approach and landing operations is of particular interest. This paper studies the benefits of integrating future GNSS navigation systems with different grade of inertial measurement units (IMUs) to improve continuity for LPV200 approaches and autolanding (it is expected that future multiconstellation GNSS scenario may provide enough performance to support these procedures). The performance of the hybrid navigation system is evaluated under different failure scenarios and with respect to different grades of IMUs and compared with the equivalent performance provided by a standalone GNSS receiver.},

  abstract = {The continued disruption of GNSS signals in the airspace has highlighted the need for RNP services based on terrestrial sources. Given the prevalence of DME in many complex airspaces and terminal areas, the target of DME/DME supporting RNP 1 is desirable. The route to adoption, however, has not been as straight forward as originally envisioned. One reason for that delay has been the threat from multipath-induced errors. This paper proposes a way of detecting and excluding multipath-affected measurements, and it predicts the achievable navigation performance, after multipath exclusion.},

  abstract = {GNSS is widely known to be vulnerable to an evolving range of threats (natural and man-made, unintentional and deliberate). This drives the demand for an alternative system to protect those critical applications that depend on GNSS from a safety, security and/or liability perspective. A potential alternative system is the R(anging)-mode concept, which is a positioning system that involves the transmission of time synchronised ranging signals using communications channels of existing m aritime radio infrastructure. VDES is the planned successor to AIS, intended to address the current issueof over-crowding of AIS. It supports shipto-ship and ship-to-coast communications as well as a satellite component. R-mode has the potential to be applied to both the terrestrial and satellite components of VDES, which may be referred to as VDE-TER R-Mode and VDE-SAT R-Mode respectively. This study presents a system and service concept for a VDE-SAT R-Mode system capable of providing PNT services through a combination of space-based and terrestrial infrastructures, providing an analysis of the user needs, performance of the VDES ranging signal, scenario analysis of various constellation architectures and considerations to the ground and sensor segment.},

  abstract = {Although the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is a widely used technology for various purposes such as autonomous driving, machine control, and construction sites, its accuracy is degraded in multipath environments, such as dense urban areas. In particular, the non-line of sight (NLOS) signal has a large multipath error. Various positioning methods, which are less affected by multipath errors, have been proposed. Integration with GNSS and other external sensors, such as inertial measurement units (IMU) and speed sensors, has been one of the most widely used methods to improve positioning accuracy. Although various integrated positioning methods have been proposed, such as loosely coupled and tightly coupled integration, the most important factor for GNSS positioning accuracy is integration. This study clarifies the benefits of using multiple GNSS antennas and receivers in GNSS positioning and loosely coupled integration with GNSS, IMU, and speed sensors compared to the use of single GNSS antennas and receivers.},

Among the different alternatives for autonomous indoor localization and navigation, Ultra-WideBand ranging is a promising solution to achieve high positioning accuracy. The key points impacting such performance are i) anchors’ geometry, and ii) a perfectly known anchors’ position. In this contribution, we provide an analysis on the navigation performance loss induced by a possible anchor’s position mismatch, and propose a method to estimate both the mobile trajectory (position and velocity) and the uncertain anchor’s position.

  abstract = {The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), an augmentation of the Global Positioning System (GPS), measures ionospheric slant delays using dual frequency receivers in a network of reference stations throughout North America to compute and broadcast a vertical Ionospheric Grid Delay (IGD) and its associated integrity bound, the Grid Ionospheric Vertical Error (GIVE) at a set of Ionospheric Grid Points (IGPs). The GIVEs are used in receiver computations and significantly determine the availability of navigation services. Since the initial fielding beginning in July 2003, WAAS has computed the vertical delay estimate and the integrity bound at each IGP using a planar fit based on neighboring measurements. In a recent WAAS release, fielded in October 2011, the IGDs and the GIVEs at the IGPs are computed using kriging estimation. Various tunable ionospheric model parameters exist in the kriging algorithm. These parameters were optimized over the full range of possible ionospheric behaviors: from nominal to storm ionosphere, and from solar maximum to solar minimum. This paper documents the methodology, implementation, and analysis for the trade study that optimized kriging algorithm performance for the range of ionospheric behaviors over the entire solar cycle. A set of 64 GIVE algorithm models with varying kriging and irregularity detector parameters were traded over a 14 day data set spanning the range of ionospheric behaviors. A final set of GIVE algorithm kriging parameters was determined through the trade study that dramatically improved system availability performance and increased system robustness against storm ionospheric activity while maintaining nominal ionospheric performance. The performance improvement is shown for a set of five recent storm days.},

Furthermore, the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) approximation of the PHD filter (also known as particle-PHD filter) is available in the literature in order to overcome its intractability. However, the PHD filter keeps no track of the target identities and hence cannot produce track-valued estimates of individual targets. This work consider the use of an improved implementation, of the particle-PHD filter that gives the track-valued estimates of individual targets and propose a novel way for doing so. The improved PHD filter combines the particles approximation of the posterior PHD function and the peak extraction from the posterior PHD particles to create the target identities of the individual estimates.

Recently, a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) implementation of PHD filter has been used in multitarget filtering with promising results. In this paper, we will compare the performance of the PHD filter with that of the multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) that has been widely used in multi-target filtering over the past decades. The Wasserstein distance is used as a measure of the multi-target miss distance in these comparisons. Furthermore, since the PHD filter does not produce target tracks, for comparison purposes, we investigated ways of integrating the data-association functionality into the PHD filter. This has lead us to devise methods for integrating the PHD filter and the MHT filter for target tracking which exploits the advantage of both approaches.},

  abstract = {The goal of this work is to discuss the concept of metasignals combining, introduced for the first time in [1]. The fundamental concept of GNSS meta-signals is to process different signals broadcast on different carrier frequencies as a single signal. The benefits of this approach with respect to other classical combining techniques are discussed in the first part of the paper. After that, an accurate analytical discussion is provided, presenting in particular the properties of the AltBOC modulation. A complete characterization of the most general asymmetric AltBOC scheme is introduced, providing a general expression for the asymmetric AltBOC power spectral density. The asymmetric AltBOC is of interest in this context because any meta-signal combination can be seen as an asymmetric AltBOC, where the two signals to be combined become the two main lobes of the AltBOC signal. Based on the analytical expression of the asymmetric AltBOC, the expected performance in terms of multipath rejection and ranging accuracy are assessed. The last part of the paper is devoted to a real signals test. Live Galileo signals are processed with an SDR receiver based on vector architecture and meta-signal tracking is performed. The receiver architecture is widely discussed and the obtained results are presented.},

  abstract = {The paper describes three new technical solutions that will be soon introduced within the Galileo E1 I/NAV message. The work leading to the design of the three solutions started with the 2012 Galileo Programme decision to re-profile the Safety-of-Life (SoL) service, thus making available a significant portion of the I/NAV message, initially marked as “reserved” in the Galileo Open Service Signal In Space Interface Control Document (OS SIS ICD, [1]). The main driver originally identified for the I/NAV message optimization work was to reduce the Time-To-First-Fix for the Galileo OS users. In particular, the design targeted on one side a shorter time to access the data necessary for the first fix (i.e. Clock and Ephemeris Data, CED) for the non-connected users and on the other a faster re-synchronization with the Galileo System Time (GST) for the connected (or assisted) users. Another key objective was to improve substantially the demodulation robustness of the Clock and Ephemeris Data (CED).},

There are two different methodologies used to implement a real-time DGPS service, which are 'block shift technique' and 'range correction'. Corrections to the coordinates of the 'block shift technique' are made by comparing known reference station position and instantaneously computed position. 'Range corrections' technique generate corrections to all pseudorange by comparing true to observed range based on the reference station coordinate. The block shift technique is the easiest way to implement, but it is available only if both the remote and base receivers use the same satellite constellation to generate their point solutions. On the other hand, the user of the 'range correction technique' can make any combination of corrected ranges, not just the reference station constellation, so it is popular real-time strategy to most DGPS systems.},

  abstract = {The necessity of indoor navigation is increasing with the growing number of firemen who died in the line of duty at the scene of the rescue. The conventional radio navigation and localization using wireless signals would malfunction in disaster, so Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) is applied to the system. In real world situations, to determine current floor is significant for identifying the location of firefighters. In this paper, the floor classification algorithm is proposed using a MEMS IMU mounted on a shoe with stair awareness. On the basis of the IMU output, PDR system is used to decide current location with step detection, step length and azimuth estimation. As a pedestrian walks inside a building, stair motion is detected through Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) prior to floor division. The proposed algorithm is based on calculating heights through EKF using inertial sensor data and Zero velocity UPdaTe (ZUPT). Various types of stairs in buildings are largely categorized into several groups with the heading estimates from EKF. With the information of a user motion and the number of stairs, a current floor is determined based on the stair types. The experimental result of the proposed algorithm shows that floor level is classified regardless of stair types and the number of stair where a pedestrian moved.},

A well-known phenomenon caused by the ionosphere is the so-called ionospheric scintillation, which affects the received amplitude and phase of a satellite signal. The dispersive nature of these ionosphere events is the reason for the largest source of error in received Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals: the effects of scintillation will affect both amplitude and phase of GNSS signals, degrading the quality of the measurements and affecting the expected accuracy. In addition, strong scintillation can cause the receiver to lose the signal lock, thus reducing the availability of the system.},

A thorough methodology was followed in the laboratory to adapt the wideband band channel model from the ITU recommendation P.681-8 for its use in the hardware simulator. For practical reasons, the channel impulse response was reduced to a simplified channel of 2 taps (LOS + echo). Also, the satellite and user dynamics were chosen carefully to maximize the number of samples in all angles of arrival providing a fair comparison when analyzing the effect of satellite elevation angles. Finally, the results of the live tests are compared against the laboratory simulations of urban and suburban versions of the ITU-R wideband model. With the positive results obtained from this validation, the authors generated a repository of channel impulse responses simulating different GNSS constellation, frequency bands, environments and user dynamics.},

  abstract = {Fully automated vehicles and mobile robots have to operate in a shared environment with pedestrians in the future. To minimize the risk for pedestrians, it is very important to track them in a precise way. One important information source is the intention of the pedestrian. For the integration of the intention information with conventional tracking algorithms, a Multi-Hypotheses filter is proposed, using a generalized potential field, which can be modeled using pedestrian movements. As the intention of the person is unknown, different hypotheses for the intention of the pedestrian are considered. The MultiHypotheses filter is used for the prediction of pedestrian trajectories and compared with a simple Kalman filter. The evaluation is performed in dependence on the free parameters, which are the prediction time, the tracking time and the measurement quality (modeled by additional additive white Gaussian noise). The proposed approach is evaluated using real camera data from a simple scenario in the Edinburgh Informatics Forum. For evaluation, the root mean square error and a confidence score, which is based on the normalized entropy, are considered. The Multi-Hypotheses based prediction outperforms the simple Kalman filter over the whole range of measurement quality, prediction and tracking time horizons in the case of the root mean square error and in the case of the confidence score.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a summer data campaign is presented to study the freshwater surface using GNSS signals reflected from Lake Michigan. To analyze the scattered power in terms of surface conditions, verification sensors are collocated with the GNSS receiver. The ground-based mobile sensor suite we have developed consists of: a reflected-GNSS antenna and universal software radio peripheral (USRP) front end; a second (direct) GNSS reference antenna and USRP; lidar; camera; weather station and supporting power and electronics. The mobile sensor suite is set up on a dock on the Lake Michigan shore in Chicago, Illinois. Data are post-processed to acquire GPS L1 signals and to estimate the sensor suite location. The weather station and collocated camera data provide the reference surface temperature and wind speed conditions. Almanac information is used to compute the specular points’ (SP) positions in the east-north-up coordinate system (ENU). To determine specular point position on the surface, a LiDAR-SP map is computed. The SP-LiDAR map helps to find the location of the SP on the water. A delay-Doppler map (DDM) is a representation of the power scattered in time delay and Doppler shift, and depends on surface conditions. A DDM is computed for the satellite whose corresponding SP is located on the water and has a high elevation angle, to minimize direct GPS signal interference. We use an incoherent integration signal processing method to compute the DDM due to the signal noise level in this work. The DDMs for both direct and reflected GPS signals are examined. DDMs generated from the directly received signal correctly show the power concentrated at the code chip and Doppler frequency of the acquired satellite, indicating that the incoherent processing is sound. The sensor suite and processing will be used in future data campaigns for detecting seasonal freshwater and surface ice variations.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the prototyping of an offline ground monitor for advanced receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (ARAIM). The ARAIM user algorithm, which includes fault detection and exclusion (FDE), is autonomously executed at the airborne receiver. To achieve specific integrity and continuity requirements, the real-time FDE process requires assertions on the signal-in-space (SIS) performance, in particular on satellite clock and orbit ephemeris error characteristics. This information is broadcast in the integrity support message (ISM). To validate the ISM, the offline ground monitor estimates precise GNSS satellite orbits and clocks which are utilized to validate the ISM. There are many sophisticated orbit determination processes such as the one used by the international GNSS service (IGS), whose performance is specified in terms of accuracy. In contrast, the proposed offline monitor (OFM) architecture is mainly intended for safety-critical aviation applications, in which integrity is of primary concern. This monitor employs a straightforward approach to estimate satellite orbit/clock using the existing satellite based augmentation system (SBAS) ground infrastructure. For prototyping purpose, twenty sparsely-distributed reference stations (RS) are selected from a worldwide network of IGS stations, and their publicly-available observation data is utilized. A parametric satellite orbital model is employed in the estimator, whose implementation is described step by step in the paper. Receiver noise and multipath (RNM) error models are analyzed and implemented for all twenty RS and the sensitivity of the monitor’s performance to the RNM model is evaluated. The prototype uses the GPS legacy orbit model and does not assume a reference station clock model. Previous covariance analyses showed that the standard deviation of the monitor’s orbit/clock estimation error was expected to be on the order of 30 centimeters. In this preliminarily evaluation, satellite orbits and clock errors are on the order of meters.},

We show that the new monitor significantly improves the detection performance over existing fault detection algorithms under tropospheric turbulence and that it is capable of meeting Category III precision approach and landing requirements.},

  abstract = {Mobile devices are desired to guide users seamlessly to diverse destinations indoors and outdoors. The positioning fixing subsystems often provide poor quality measurements with gaps in an urban environment. No single position fixing technology works continuously. Many sensor fusion variations have been previously trialed to overcome this challenge, including the particle filter that is robust and the Kalman filter which is fast. However, a lack exists, of context aware, seamless systems that are able to use the most fit sensors and methods in the correct context. A novel adaptive and modular tripartite navigation filter design is presented to enable seamless navigation. It consists of a sensor subsystem, a context inference and a navigation filter blocks. A foot-mounted inertial measurement unit (IMU), a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Ultrawideband (UWB) positioning systems were used in the evaluation implementation of this design. A novel recursive 2-means clustering method was developed to track multiple hypotheses when there are gaps in position fixes. The closest hypothesis to a new position fix is selected when the gap ends. Moreover, when the position fix quality measure is not reliable, a fusion approach using a Tukey-style particle filter measurement update is introduced. Results show the successful operation of the design implementation. The Tukey update improves accuracy by 5\% and together with the clustering method the system robustness is enhanced.},

  abstract = {GNSS-based spacecraft formation flying in LEO presents new opportunities for ionospheric remote sensing. This work demonstrates the successful application of ionospheric tomography using the newly developed Virginia Tech Formation Flying Testbed (VTFFTB), a GNSS-based HIL simulation testbed for spacecraft formation flight. Scenarios of GNSS-based satellite formation flying missions for ionospheric remote sensing have been proposed, demonstrated, and validated on the VTFFTB. The current configuration of VTFFTB consists of GNSS RF hardware signal simulators, multi-constellation multi-frequency GNSS receivers, a navigation \& control system, an STK visualization system, and an ionospheric remote sensing system. GPS signals were emulated from the GNSS simulator under the scenarios that include customized ionospheric phenomena. A receiver was utilized to track a pair of spacecraft (“chief” and “deputy”) orbiting in formation. Using both differential GPS measurements and a relative motion dynamics model, an EKF was implemented in the navigation \& control system to estimate the relative state between two spacecraft in real time. A flight controller uses the estimated relative state to maneuver the deputy spacecraft instantaneously, which completes the closed-loop simulation. A reference scenario of two LEO spacecraft was simulated with the initial in-track separation of 1000 m and targeted leader-follower configuration of 100 m along-track offset, which demonstrated the testbed feasibility and performance by benchmarking with past reference simulation results. Multi-constellation multi-frequency GNSS receivers were used to develop the ionospheric remote sensing system with TEC and scintillation measurement capabilities. A special scenario of ionospheric irregularities that include Equatorial Spread F with a modelled plasma bubble region was simulated, and a LEO formation flying mission with two satellites were designed to probe the irregularity region. HIL simulations using the VTFFTB were run to validate the mission concept and evaluate the measurement results. This work demonstrates that the GPS-based satellite formation is able to probe the space-based TEC, vertical electron density, S4, and identify the structure of irregularities. The entire infrastructure of GNSS-based spacecraft formation flying simulation and ionospheric remote sensing is capable of supporting more novel upper atmospheric mission designs and validation.},

  abstract = {GNSS has become an indispensable information infrastructure in our daily life for its function in positioning and timing. But along with its wide application, the security of GNSS is receiving growing concern. Intermediate spoofing, which utilizes the working mechanism of GNSS tracking loop to covertly take over target receiver, poses the most serious near-term threat to GNSS receiver. In order to find corresponding defensive measures, it is essential to understand how GNSS tracking loop reacts to intermediate spoofing. In this paper, simulation framework that mimics actual attack scenario is developed. Through examination of simulation attack, the basic principle behind intermediate spoofing is reviewed. On the basis of above analysis, vulnerability of tracking loops with different loop parameters, such as loop bandwidth and phase discriminator to intermediate spoofing, is evaluated. Furthermore, innovative tracking loop which takes advantage of the redundancy of tracking are evaluated against intermediate spoofing.},

Previously, the project, known as Jammer Acquisition with GPS Exploration and Reconnaissance or JAGER, has demonstrated capabilities of localizing a signal source in real time by physically rotating the antenna, however this approach proved to be a slow approach to localization [1]. Since that demonstration, the sensor has been upgraded to be electronically steered, the localizing algorithm and path planning has been improved to account for the higher rate of bearing measurements, and a GNSS independent navigation system has been developed. Each of these pieces have been demonstrated individually in both flight tests and simulation, however, until now, the full system has not been operated together in real-time [2]–[4]. This paper presents the real-time implementation of all the core sub-systems making up the JAGER platform working together to localizing a signal source in a GNSS denied environment.},

  abstract = {Radio frequency interference (RFI) is a challenge that has, and continues to be, faced by the aviation industry today. This is especially true for GNSS in aviation as these signals are particularly weak. Interference comes in many forms ranging from short transient events to longer duration events, and are often caused by unintentional radiators, however all of these scenarios have the possibility to pose a risk to GNSS users. Many techniques exist to localize a signal source, however, these techniques typically rely on knowing the position from which a set of measurements are made. Therefore, when the source being localized creates a GNSS denied environment there become two problems to solve: localizing the interferer and navigating in the denied environment caused by the interferer. An unmanned aerial system (UAS) built on a multirotor platform, known as JAGER, is being developed to solve these two challenges [1].},

  abstract = {Pedestrian location in urban or indoor environments is particularly complex. Indeed, GNSS technology generally used for localization is no longer sufficient in these challenging environments. However, the presence of many sensors in consumer equipment like smartphones allows the implementation of different methods. PDR (Pedestrian Dead Reckoning) is a position estimation method using inertial and magnetic sensor data. It is based on the determination of two elements: the step length and the walking direction. This direction is difficult to estimate for handheld sensors because the orientation of the sensor is not always aligned with the walking direction. Methods based on the study of horizontal hand accelerations can overcome this difficulty, but performance on real scenarios is not sufficient. This article proposes a new method for estimating the walking direction and position based on an extended Kalman filter. For this purpose, the angular estimates from the WAISS and MAGYQ algorithms are merged to update the estimate of the walking direction. Phase measurements are used with TDCP updates to correct the velocity and correct the walking direction. 6 experiments carried out with three subjects over distances between 650 and 1300m in texting mode, in real and challenging conditions are conducted. The mean angular error obtained is 4.6° and the mean position error is 0.5\% of the travelled distance.},

This includes comparisons to specifications for nominal GPS signal deformation and also assumptions for acceptable WAAS user range errors in the presence of one anomaly event. It is shown that these assumptions continue to hold and that this method may provide a complement to high-gain dish antenna measurements for assessing the effects of signal deformations in GNSS receivers on an ongoing basis.},

They have traditionally relied on a combination of empirical measurements and analytical models of the threats and the user receivers. In the future however, to mitigate ionospheric errors, WAAS will leverage the L5 signal in addition to L1. This means both signals will need to be monitored. While many familiar C/A code signal deformation monitor analyses can be extended and applied to the L5 codes, the monitor needs to be far more sensitive since the dual-frequency combination designed to remove ionospheric errors will amplify any range biases on the signal. At the same time, this correction will drive the range error limits to be smaller. In addition, the new signal deformation monitor needs to detect potential faults on the L5 signal—a something the current design is not easily adapted to do.},

An identification algorithm is applied to the data from the simulation, and the model in the form of a transfer function is an identification result. The oscillatory behavior is detected, and this result is confirmed by frequency analysis of the recorded pressure measurements. One of the resonant frequencies is the same in both experiments, but the second is slightly different.

  abstract = {This paper defines the major system components of a navigation system that integrates a star tracker observing satellites on a star background with an inertial measurement unit (IMU). By modeling the components and their respective errors their contribution to the navigation position error is evaluated to reflect the key performing parameters. The scenario of interest models the navigation performance of a moving vehicle that integrated an IMU with a star tracker. By imaging a satellite on a star background, the star tracker measures two angles. Those angles, when associated with a time, describe a 3-D line of sight vector on which the observer must lie. This research determines the component error sources to such measurements and the expected performance of a navigation system that integrates these measurements with an inertial system. The results show the expected navigation error vary according to star tracker quality, satellite ephemeris error, IMU quality, and observed satellite selection algorithm. The method described in this work improves on previous celestial navigation techniques by tightly integrating the measured line of sight angles with an IMU while using the physical specifications of the sensors to define the measurement accuracy.},

Unlike Wi-Fi or Bluetooth signals, however, the UWB signal has characteristics that make it particularly useful for short-range and indoor distance measurements. As a result, UWB-based technologies have established themselves in numerous application areas where accuracy and frequency are crucial. UWB positioning systems are nowadays used to track the movement of people and guide them in navigation tasks in hospitals, stadiums, public offices and subways. They are also mounted on land vehicles and aircraft for autonomous navigation applications as well as used for various applications in retail, healthcare and industrial automation. The integration of UWB sensors in new-generation smartphones opens up new opportunities in the field of positioning and navigation, especially with the widespread use of mobile phones and their intensive use in everyday life. In this article, a comprehensive study on UWB ranging with smartphones is presented. Unlike previous literature, where external UWB sensors were integrated with mobile phones, our study is based on the analysis of systems already integrated within mobile phones and their integration with android APIs. In particular, the focus is on analysing the (relative) ranging performance between two mobile phones equipped with UWB chipsets and providing an overview of the android APIs and their compatibility with UWBs.},

The characteristics of the artifacts have led to a consideration that the artifacts are a consequence of ionospheric scintillation. This raises not only a concern about scintillation effects on radar but also a question about active scintillation conditions during a low solar activity year. To assess and verify the scintillation conditions, GPS data collected from the constellation of FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC satellites and three groundbased GPS networks are processed and analyzed. The space and ground GPS data provides a global context and regional dense coverage, respectively, of ionospheric scintillation measurements. It is concluded that even during a low solar activity year, L-band scintillation at low latitudes can occur frequently and affect L-band SAR significantly.},

  abstract = {Autonomous robotic systems will play an important role in future planetary exploration missions. To allow autonomous operation of robots, reliable navigation is vital. Such a navigation solution is provided by cooperative radio navigation, where radio signals are exchanged among the robots. Based on the signal round-trip time (RTT) and direction-of-arrival (DoA), the robots’ positions and orientations are estimated. Cooperative navigation has been well studied theoretically, but experiments mainly focused on indoor scenarios and other applications. For the first time, we have demonstrated cooperative radio navigation within a space-analogue exploration mission with two robotic rovers. The mission took place on the volcano Mt Etna, Sicily, Italy. During the first part of the mission, simultaneous localization and calibration (SLAC) is performed to improve the accuracy of RTT and DoA estimates by reducing the bias. Then, the rovers travel to a distant area of interest. Ultimately, one rover travels so far that it is connected to the network only via another rover. We find that even in this challenging single-link scenario, robust cooperative navigation is achieved. When the rovers are not further than 60 m away from the lander, their position root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) are 0.3 m to 0.9 m. Even for the most challenging mission phase, when the rovers are 100 m to 160 m away from the lander with single-link localization, the position RMSEs are 1.7 m to 2.6 m. The orientation RMSEs of the rovers lie between 2.4◦ to 6.1◦. Thus, with this spaceanalogue mission, we show that cooperative radio navigation for planetary exploration is robust and accurate.},

  abstract = {Autonomous robotic system will play a crucial role in future exploration missions to Mars or the Moon. Autonomous operation requires reliable navigation and communication. While a satellite communication and navigation system for the Moon is planned, only few satellites are foreseen. Accuracy and availability can be increased by a local radio system for communication and cooperative navigation. Based on the signal round-trip time (RTT) and direction-of-arrival (DoA), positions and orientations of the robots are estimated. Accurate distance estimation by the RTT requires calibrated transceiver and antenna group delays, and accurate DoA estimation requires antenna calibration. Usually, these calibrations are performed once before the system becomes operational. However, calibration parameters can change, for instance due to varying temperature of RF components or reconfigurable antenna surroundings. Thus, we propose to estimate antenna responses and direction-dependent ranging biases simultaneously with positions and orientations by simultaneous localization and calibration (SLAC). In this paper, we derive a SLAC algorithm, which is suitable for arbitrary antenna types. The algorithm is then evaluated with measurement data obtained in a Moon-analogue mission with robotic rovers that took place on the volcano Mt Etna, Sicily. We show that by SLAC, the position error of the robots is reduced by more than a factor of two.},

Said datadriven system makes use of meteorological and astronomical data to assist aircraft in navigating in order to mitigate acquisition errors and optimize the quality of acquired data. It is found that reliably extracting aircraft orientation is critical to our approach, to that end, we present a GPS alignment methodology which makes use of the fusion of two GPS signals. Using the complementary strengths and weaknesses of these two signals a synthetic interpolation of fused data is used to generate more reliable flight tracks, substantially improving glare modelling. This methodology could be applied to any other applications with similar signal restrictions.},

  abstract = {We argued the merits of having a simplified method to simulate equatorial plasma bubble (EPB) plume structures in the context of practical usage. The presence of EPBs in low-latitude ionosphere during nighttime hours is known to pose significant threat to technological systems that rely on global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and communication satellites (SATCOM). Such threat arises due to steep gradients in ionospheric total electron content (TEC) associated with EPBs and due to amplitude scintillations of radio signals by plasma density irregularities that reside within the EPBs. A capability to realistically model EPB plume structures in simulations would be helpful in providing better technical assessment regarding the severity of such ionospheric threats. A prospect of better assessment would emerge in this case because a realistic model of EPB plume structures could allow for non-stationary scintillation signals to be simulated. This is in contrast to standard phase-screen model of ionospheric scintillations, which typically only considers stationary fluctuations caused by uniformly distributed Fresnelscale plasma density irregularities, not irregularities that are localized within individual branches of the EPB plume structures. Although EPB plume structures can be modeled using first principle physics-based models, such physics-based models tend to be computationally demanding and this limitation could become a significant handicap for practical usage. High-performance computing facilities might be able to offer some remedy, but the aforementioned handicap would remain for those without access to such advanced facilities. In our recent research efforts, we have experimented on some options that utilize the diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) fractal process to generate bifurcating structures that closely resemble typical EPB plume structures. We combined the numerical DLA algorithm with the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) model, an empirical zonal drift velocity model, and quasi-dipole geomagnetic field model to simulate EPBs in 3-dimensional configuration. Initial tests of this modeling approach indicate promising results.},

The development of this EPB climatology tool is motivated by threats posed by EPB and scintillations to the availability and integrity of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) applications in civil aviation. With a steady growth in the adoption of ground-based augmentation systems (GBAS) and space-based augmentation systems (SBAS) at airports and airspaces around the globe, a general familiarity in EPB and scintillation occurrence climatology is gradually becoming a key priority. Such a basic familiarity with the climatological patterns of EPB and scintillation occurrence would be necessary not only for those in the research and development sides of aviation-related GNSS applications, but possibly also for those in the operational, management, and policy-making sides of civil aviation. This prototype EPB climatology tool systematically summarizes the spatial and temporal variability of EPB and low-latitude ionospheric scintillation occurrence around the globe based on a representative set of empirical data gathered from the scientific literature. On the spatial variability aspect, the program delineates the dependence of EPB and scintillation occurrence probability on longitude and latitude. On the temporal variability aspect, the program delineates the dependence of EPB and scintillation occurrence probability on seasons of the year, hour of the day, and the 11-year solar cycle. In addition to long-term climatology, the program also summarizes the expected effects of geomagnetic activity on the EPB occurrence likelihood. We have presently implemented this EPB climatology tool in two separate formats: one as a MATLAB program and another version in HTML/Javascript for ease of access on a Boston College web server.},

  abstract = {Using a chain of ground-based GPS receiver stations from the RBMC network, we studied the distribution of ionospheric total electron content (TEC) gradient magnitudes over the Brazilian airspace and its variation throughout the maximum phase of Solar Cycle 24. The GPS receiver stations used for this study form an east-west chain along the southern crest of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA), where we may expect the largest TEC gradient magnitudes and the most severe cases of ionospheric scintillations to occur due to equatorial plasma bubbles (EPB). Multiyear GPS observation data from 2011 to 2016 were analyzed for the ionospheric TEC gradient calculations. The calculated TEC gradient values from January-March period in each year were subsequently aggregated to construct the distribution histogram of the ionospheric TEC gradient magnitudes. We found that the ionospheric TEC gradient magnitude distribution in each year follows a form of double-power-law distribution with a clearly visible break, in general agreement with a number of previously reported results [Pradipta and Doherty, 2016a, 2016b; Pradipta et al., 2016]. Furthermore, we also found that the two exponents of the aforementioned double-power-law vary systematically from one year to the next following the evolution of the solar cycle. In the year(s) when the sunspot number was higher, the tail of the TEC gradient magnitude distribution shifted upward, indicating a more frequent occurrence of extreme TEC gradients over the area. It is hoped that these findings would be useful for projecting the level of threats to GBAS/SBAS services at various phases of the solar cycle.},

Many efforts have been conducted to overcome these problems with the main idea of efficiently mapping the ionosphere for applications concerning geodetic positioning, telecommunication and space weather. In this regard, tomographic algorithms have been continuously investigated by the authors and, in this paper, we present an overview of a method that significantly improved the results for the regional estimation. The proposed method is based on a new climatological model developed with ionosonde and Radio-Occultation (RO) measurements, which revealed new spatial and temporal features of the of topside scale height and its gradient. The climatological model was also developed to obtain an initial guess of the ionosphere, i.e. a background. Then, a new version of the Multiplicative Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (MART) was used to iteratively update the background by adding information retrieved from ground-based measurements of Total Electron Content (TEC). As a result, three-dimensional representations were generated, applied and assessed in the single-frequency Precise Point Positioning (PPP). Additional results are presented about the performance of the method to describe the ionospheric topside and bottomside and for mapping plasma bubbles.},

  abstract = {This paper presents and evaluates cooperative navigation methods used to reduce navigation solution error growth between members of an unmanned aerial vehicle - unmanned ground vehicle (UAV-UGV) team when Global Position System (GPS) measurements are partially or completely unavailable to the group. A scenario in which two UAVs and one UGV travel in a cooperative team was simulated with a centralized navigation algorithm based on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and with a decentralized navigation algorithm based on the Covariance Intersection (CI) filter. Measurements including relative range, relative range-rate, and relative bearing were made available to the vehicles in different simulation runs to compare their impact on navigation state observability and navigation state estimation accuracy. The UAVs were also guided along varied trajectories of a “spiral" class during different simulation runs to investigate whether estimation accuracy can be improved by varying intervehicle dynamics and geometry. To analyze the observability of the studied scenarios, a condition number test was performed on the observability Gramian matrix. This study indicates that the navigation state observability in cooperative navigation scenarios where a kinematic vehicle model is aided with relative measurements can be improved by the proposed vehicle maneuver. As the rate of the proposed spiral maneuver is increased, this analysis suggests an improvement in observability. This result is further validated in the simulated results which show that with relative bearing only, even low rates of inter-vehicle spiral motion allow for estimates of relative position with less than 3 meters of error. As the spiral rate increases, accurate relative positioning is shown to be possible with only relative range measurements. The loss of inter-vehicle covariance information encountered in the decentralized case resulted in a significant reduction of positioning accuracy that varied depending on vehicle maneuver and available relative measurements. Lastly, an experimental hardware implementation of the simulated scenarios was performed to validate the simulation results. This experiment demonstrated similar results to the simulated scenarios. Relative position error was reduced from over 100 meters to sub-meter accuracy, depending on relative measurement availability. Absolute error was also reduced from over 70 meters (in the IMU-only case) to meter-level accuracy depending on measurement availability.},

  abstract = {A new global navigation system concept is studied that relies entirely on carrier Doppler shift measurements from the downlink signals of a large LEO constellation. This system seeks to provide a back-up or alternative to existing pseudorange-based MEO GNSS by exploiting the large LEO constellations that are currently being planned or fielded, constellations such as Starlink, OneWeb, and Kuiper. The navigation concept is based on a high-fidelity model of the received carrier Doppler shift. This model is used to develop a point-solution nonlinear least-squares batch filter that simultaneously estimates 8 unknowns: the 3 components of the position vector, the receiver clock offset, the 3 components of the velocity vector, and the receiver clock offset rate. The filter must use 8 or more measured carrier Doppler shifts in its least-squares fit in order to make its 8 unknowns observable. A generalized GDOP analysis has been developed for this system. It indicates that absolute position accuracies on the order of 1-5 meters and absolute velocity accuracies on the order of 0.01 to 0.05 m/sec may be achievable if the range-rate precision of the carrier Doppler shift measurements is 0.01 m/sec. These accuracies are comparable to current pseudorange-based GNSS. Clock offset accuracy is on the order of 0.0001 to 0.0010 sec 1-σ, which is orders of magnitude poorer than current pseudorange-based GNSS. This degraded clock accuracy occurs because clock error standard deviation is inversely proportional to the maximum range acceleration between the satellites and the receiver. Batch filter point-solution results for truth-model simulation data confirm the conclusions of the GDOP analysis. One set of truth-model simulations considers the effects of satellite ephemeris and clock frequency errors. They indicate that good performance can be achieved with 1-σ ephemeris errors of 2 m in position and 0.002 m/sec in velocity and with 1-σ transmitter clock frequency errors of 3.3×10−11 seconds/second. This level of transmitter clock stability could be achieved with a high quality quartz oscillator, thereby obviating any need for the satellites to carry atomic clocks or to use GPS disciplining of their oscillators.},

These tracking algorithms are being developed with the goal of using their derived observables to navigate by fusing them with corresponding observables from a reference station and with pressure altimeter data. The DLL and PLL feedback discriminator outputs are computed by solving an optimal fitting problem in the frequency domain for each OFDM symbol. A second-order DLL is used to cope with significant transmitter-induced code/carrier divergence. The outputs of the DLL and the PLL and used to determine, respectively, standard pseudorange and accumulated delta range observables. Single-differencing of these observables between a roving user receiver and a reference station receiver at a known location can remove the transmitter clock drift effects to yield navigation observables. Wideband data collected in Roanoke, VA, and in Charlotte, NC, have been processed off-line and used to study the suitability of such signals for navigation purposes. Pseudorange measurement and bias errors can be on the order of 100 m, but accumulated delta range precision can be better than 0.1 m. Multipath, however, can cause significant degradation of a receiver’s tracking capability and of the quality of its navigation observables. Examples of these effects are presented as are potential mitigation techniques. A system that uses accumulated delta range may be able to yield 5-m level positioning accuracy if multipath effects can be compensated. Current pseudorange-only solutions, however, exhibit errors on the order of 100s of m.},

In our study, we used the code-only-based Single Point Positioning technique for epoch-by-epoch positioning, and the Precise Point Positioning technique, which is based on both code and carrier-phase measurements, on precise satellite orbit and clock corrections, as well as on a dynamic model to exploit the time-constant property of the phase ambiguities. The functional model used in both our own SPP and PPP algorithms is based on the uncombined GNSS observation equations. As the Xiaomi Mi 8 smartphone is able to track both GPS and Galileo systems in two frequencies, we will present results based on single and combined GNSS solutions in single- and dual-frequency mode. The performance of these solutions will be assessed in terms of their repeatability and accuracy with respect to the ground-truth, while the improvement in Android-based positioning with multiple frequencies and GNSSs will be assessed compared to the GPS L1-only SPP case. An optimal combination of the elevation cut-off angle and the carrier-to-noise density ratio mask will be explored in order to have a reasonable balance between availability and quality of observations. Both real-time and post-processing positioning results will be presented.},

  abstract = {In this publication a new workflow of point cloud processing for LiDAR-based trajectory planning and collision avoidance is proposed, which enables autonomous vehicles such as UAV to navigate in semi-unknown environments. Semi-unknown means that no complete map of the area and of potential obstacles is available. To guarantee safe operation of the UAV, a low-level collision avoidance based on LiDAR-data is proposed. The approach consists of a voxel-grid-based downsampling, kd-tree-construction for efficient 3D range searching, a novel modification of the Euclidian clustering approach that is used for computationally inexpensive object detection, path planning based on artificial potential fields, and a final generation of a feasible trajectory by means of a model predictive controller (MPC).The proposed modification of the Euclidean clustering algorithm consists in choosing adaptive radii for the spherical search areas around the LiDAR points and yields superior clustering results for several test measurements in various environments than the existing algorithm that uses a fixed search radius while causing only negligible additional computational cost. Besides, the introduction of artificial potential fields to LiDAR measurements for trajectory planning and collision avoidance is proposed. By modelling point clouds as spatial distributions of electrical charges, an analytical expression for the potential field can be obtained. Subsequently, an arbitrarily smooth path to circumvent all obstacles is generated using gradient-descent based on which a feasible trajectory can be obtained by model predictive control. This novel approach for collision avoidance significantly reduces computational cost compared to graph-based state-of-the-art path planning solutions such as the A*-algorithm and its numerous derivatives, thus allowing near real-time solving of the 3D perception and cognition problem, i.e. obstacle detection and trajectory planning. Considering that the physical limits of payload capacity and power supply impose hard constraints for the available computing power on UAV, smaller computational cost offers a decisive advantage in order to enable low-latency on-boardprocessing of the sensor data. In order to evaluate the proposed approach, all algorithms were successfully applied to several static point clouds in a cluttered office environment. Additionally, near real-time capability was ensured by implementing the object detection and the trajectory planning on two asynchronous threads of an AscTec Mastermind board for UAV, equipped with an Intel Core i7-3517UE Dual-Core-CPU with 2 x 1.7 GHz. While the object detection thread was successfully running at variable refresh rates of approximately 1-10 Hz depending on the complexity of the scene, i.e. the size of the point cloud or the available free space, respectively, the trajectory planning including the MPC fulfilled the requirement of running independently on a separate thread at a fixed clock rate of 100 Hz.},

Today's GPS satellites are normally uploaded with new data every 24 hours, and as this data ages, it becomes less representative of the current satellite status. Thus, satellite errors tend to grow predictably with age of data.},

Recently, Google, along with several automobile manufacturers has rapid progress in this field, leading them to test it on public roads. Precise positioning technology is one of the keys in this advance technology. It is relatively easy to obtain its precise position (i.e., 10 centimeters) using real time kinematic (RTK) in open sky area. Considering the vehicle will be operated in all kinds of environment, the positioning system should be able to provide robust localization information in harsh environment. Most of the driving environment is blocked by trees or high buildings, it is especially difficult to get a “fixed” solution for RTK algorithm in such environments. Sometimes, it is also difficult to get position information by single point positioning (SPP) because less than four satellite are visible. This paper describes a tightly-couple integrated positioning system using MEMS IMU and low-cost single frequency GNSS receiver for vehicle driving in urban area. The design objective is to realize accuracy and robust position in various streets environment.},

The direct-path signal is then restored by removing the estimated multipath components from the total received signal. The RF-based multipath estimation method is evaluated in one multipath scenario under weak signal environments with multipath estimation delay lock loop (MEDLL) as the benchmark. The simulation results show that the RF-based estimator has better parameter estimation and multipath mitigation performances than MEDLL in weak signal environments. It is also found that the proposed multipath signal parameter estimator performs well with limited number of correlators, demonstrating its feasibility.},

  abstract = {The presence of Radio-Frequency Interference (RFI) to Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals could bring severe threats to GNSS dependent applications and demands for effective countermeasures. Among the typical sources of anthropogenic interferers, the swept-frequency jammers are characterized by generating overpower signals with carrier frequency varying over GNSS signal bands, thus leading to disruptive effects on GNSS receiver performance. In order to counteract such types of jamming signals, the well-known Adaptive Notch Filter (ANF) is particularly appealing due to its low complexity and low computational load. Nevertheless, the residual contribution of the jamming signal after the mitigation and the presence of the ANF itself might introduce a vestigial signal distortion which is significant for high accuracy positioning. This paper presents the analysis at the tracking stage of a GNSS receiver equipped with an ANF in case of swept-frequency (chirp) jamming signals, assessing the distortion in terms of bias and shape deformation of the Delay Lock Loop (DLL) discrimination function, and using the Interference Error Envelope (IEE) and code jitter as key metrics.},

  abstract = {In order to improve the accuracy of surface ship navigation system, the fully autonomous navigation technique for the integrated navigation using the marine inertial navigation system (INS) and star sensor is used. This method employs navigation information from a star sensor as a benchmark to perform periodic recalibration of the divergent positioning error of INS. However, the position calculation of star sensor needs horizontal attitude information provided by INS. Therefore, the inertial horizontal attitude error is coupled to the star sensor calculation, which results in inaccurate description of the system model. To address this problem, the integrated navigation method using marine inertial navigation system and star sensor based on model predictive filtering (MPF) is proposed in this paper. The MPF uses predictive output tracking measurement output to correct the system model to achieve star sensor positioning error suppression. The estimated position error is fed back to star sensor to obtain accurate location information. Then, the accurate positioning information is used as the reference, and then fed back to the integrated navigation system to obtain high-precision navigation information. Finally, the method is verified by simulation, and the effectiveness of the method is verified by the real ship test on the lake surface.},

  abstract = {Inertial positioning technology is one of the most important positioning techniques. It is suitable for environments without GPS, lack of radio base stations or have no priori geographic information. The pedestrian location system based on Micro Inertial Measurement Unit (MIMU) is usually integrated in the foot of the pedestrian and using the inertial law to solve the pedestrian's position, velocity and attitude information. What’s more, the inertial location system utilizes the Zero Velocity Update (ZUPT) algorithm to suppress their errors. However, ZUPTs cannot effectively decrease pedestrian position errors and heading angle error. So pedestrian’s position errors and heading angle error will still accumulate over time. Because the magnetometer can detect earth's magnetic field information and solving the heading angle by it, in this paper, a dual MIMU/ magnetometer/ ultrasonic pedestrian location scheme is proposed. The two MIMUs, two magnetometers and two ultrasonic modules are respectively fixed on the left and right foot of pedestrians, and the output information of magnetometer is used to assist the ZUPT algorithm to calculate the locating information, which suppresses positioning error and heading error. We use two ultrasonic modules to measure the spatial relative position relation of pedestrian’s left foot and right foot in real time and construct the second order nonlinear constraint equation. We correct pedestrian position information continually by using this constraints so that to improve the positioning accuracy. To verify this program, in this paper, some experiments have been carried out. We have designed different pedestrian trajectories in certain building. After the experiment we processed and analyzed the offline data from this integrated positioning system. The experimental results show that compared with single MIMU pedestrian location scheme, pedestrian positioning technology based on dual MIMU/ magnetometer/ ultrasonic module has higher positioning accuracy, and the positioning accuracy of this system is better in the longer time, which can meet the requirement of pedestrian positioning where there is no external auxiliary information.},

This paper first demonstrates that a single cumulative monitor becomes increasingly sensitive to measurement error model uncertainty as the accumulation interval increases. As a result, the monitor’s false alarm and missed detection rates can differ significantly from predefined design parameters. In response, we investigate the use of a bank of cumulative innovations monitors for measurement fault detection in multisensor navigation systems. Focusing on a tightly coupled GPS+inertial EKF, high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulation that includes real-world model uncertainty demonstrates that the monitor bank maintains tighter compliance with specified false alert and missed detection requirements. The simulations also quantify the ability of multiple monitors to reduce time-to-detect. Practical considerations including implications for mitigation are discussed.},

The successful results obtained by the authors during prior work on magnetic-based GN algorithms (MAGNAV), tested in computer simulations, motivated the implementation of a GN module to be incorporated in the Robotic Operating System (ROS) installed on an autonomous marine vehicle of the MEDUSA class. The development work included: acquisition of prior magnetic maps in an offshore area of Lisbon; execution of data-acquisition tests using a MEDUSA vehicle equipped with a towed magnetometer; development of a medusa gn package and testing of its capabilities as a GN module of the ROS system installed on-board MEDUSA. A realistic assessment of the performance of the MAGNAV method was performed in simulations by exploiting, for the first time, the ROS capability of playing back the recorded data as if the vehicle were operating in real-time. The results obtained in the present work confirm the good performance of the MAGNAV filter observed in previous tests in terms of vehicle position estimation and pave the way for a new series of tests aimed at the validation of GN algorithms in real-time navigation experiments.},

The baseline HARAIM algorithm iteratively solves for a single protection level across all hypotheses, which is equivalent to optimally allocating the integrity risk requirement across all hypotheses for PL evaluation. This optimization process is separately carried out twice, in the East and North directions. In this paper, we perform this iterative process only once: we show that it is computationally more efficient and can provide a tighter bound on horizontal radial positioning errors than the baseline HPL. We derive a generalized chi-square formulation of the HPL to quantify the tightness of both the baseline and the proposed HPL bounds. We conduct a worldwide risk analysis to compare baseline, and new HPL approaches in terms of coverage of 100\% availability.},

The large angular variations generated by these fast-moving LEO satellites are exploited for rapid estimation of floating valued cycle ambiguities. The addition of mega-constellations to GNSS also improves the spatial diversity of ranging sources which enables improved navigation performance in areas where visible GNSS satellites are too few to obtain a position fix, such as in dense cities and urban canyons.

  abstract = {The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is currently used in many fields, such as autonomous driving, robotics application, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), where accurate position information is required. These applications require high positioning accuracy which, in turn, require precise analysis of the residual noise characteristics of the GNSS positioning solutions and their quantitative models. This paper investigates the Generalized Method of Wavelet Moments (GMWM) method for stochastic modelling of low-cost GNSS receiver signal. The paper also compares the results of GMWM to the Allan Variance (AV) which is currently the most common method to study the stochastic characteristics of different time series. Different datasets were collected using two low-cost GNSS receivers at different frequencies and were processed in Single Point Positioning (SPP) mode where position errors are expressed in the Local-Level Frame (LLF) of reference. Both techniques were used in identifying and characterizing the different latent stochastic process and their related coefficients for GNSS position residual signals where precise models of the latter have been built. The test results showed that for low-cost GNSS receivers, a white noise process alone is not sufficient for accurate position residual signals’ modeling. The results also stressed out that the GNSS error signal models are complicated where the corresponding error model structures were represented as a sum of white noise and one or more 1st order Gauss-Markov (GM) processes which indicates the existence of short and relatively long correlation between consecutive observations, especially for observations collected at higher sampling rates. Moreover, the results showed that the GMWM approach in general outperforms the AV method in terms of correlated noise identification and characterization.},

  abstract = {The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is often considered as the solution of choice for navigating in outdoor environments. However, in the specific care of urban environments, the information delivered by a GNSS receiver is not very precise and may even be unavailable. For this reason, in most cases, the positioning task is realized by coupling of a satellite geo-referencing system with sensors such as odometers, inertial units, etc. To reduce the cost of such navigation solution for land vehicles, the three-dimensional reduced inertial sensor system (3D-RISS) algorithm has been developed for integration with GNSS to provide integrated navigation solution for land vehicles. The inertial sensors are accurate in the short term but drift over time. A solution is then to use other exteroceptive sensors such as cameras and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The estimation of camera’s egomotion over time is known as visual odometry (VO). Although pose estimation can be achieved by evaluating the best estimate for the essential matrix using Nistér’s 5-point algorithm, iterative estimation from feature correspondences always causes errors that will accumulate over time and lead to drifts that even robust pose-graph optimization algorithms cannot avoid. To remedy this problem, an optimization process such as bundle adjustment is generally applied to optimize the estimation of camera poses and 3D-landmark parameters simultaneously. To make use of this optimization method, we employ structure-from-motion (SfM) techniques by exploiting the projective geometry between 3D-landmarks and their respective projections into 2D imagery. The integration of structure-from-motion algorithms for a single camera with other positioning sensors have been rarely studied, therefore the ultimate goal of this paper is to develop and present results for an integrated SfM/3D-RISS/GNSS system. The resulting solution exhibits improved positioning accuracy over the conventional 2D-2D motion estimation method under certain conditions. Experimental verification of the proposed solution is illustrated through two real road trajectories that were performed on two different land vehicles. A description is provided to show the performance of such integration in details during GNSS outages that last up to 10 minutes.},

  abstract = {The reliability and robustness of an integrated positioning system are crucial in the fields of robotics and autonomous navigation. Utilizing inertial navigation systems (INS) with Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is not sufficient as the integrated navigation performance inevitably degrades in urban areas due to extended GNSS outages. For these reasons, multiple variants of visual odometry (VO) have been developed in hope to correct INS position, attitude, and bias estimates under challenging GNSS environments. However, state-of-the-art visual-inertial odometry (VIO) algorithms lack well-defined uncertainty estimations. The tuning of the noise covariance is done heuristically, which implies that data-dependent tuning is needed to achieve high performance or even convergence of the navigation filters. To tackle this issue, we propose Voronoi Diagram-aided Visual Inertial Odometry (VD-VIO), which makes use of Voronoi Diagrams by exploiting the impact of feature distribution to the end positioning and navigation solution. To model this error, we engineer a feature set specifically designed to provide insight into the VO performance. A multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) is then adopted to obtain positional and attitudinal confidence metrics, which are then used to adjust the error covariance matrix coefficients dynamically, thus enabling a better correction of IMU PVA and bias errors, hence improving the overall integrated navigation solution in case of GNSS outages. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method by showing the VIO/GNSS system’s performance with and without learned uncertainties.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose an approach to solution of the attitude determination problem using multiple GNSS antennas. In general, the least squares approach to the attitude determination leads to the non-convex optimization problem. Standard approach proposed by G.Wahba, (see [1,2]) consists in minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals between the baseline vectors measured in the local horizon frame and the same vectors, but determined by a rotation from the body frame to the local horizon. The advantage of the Wahba method is its ease of implementation. The expression to be minimized does not contain terms quadratically dependent on the rotation matrix entries. Thus, the least squares problem reduces to maximizing the linear form of the matrix to be found over the set of orthogonal matrices. This problem is then solved via SVD decomposition (see [3]). To take into account the correlation between the coordinates of the baselines, the Wahba problem can be formulated in terms of the generalized least-squares problem by introducing a weight matrix. However, the main advantage of the Wahba method disappears, because now the term that depends quadratically on the orthogonal matrix does not vanish.},

In future the constellation of navigation satellites will be enhanced by Galileo, Compass, QZSS. Large satellite constellation, improvement of ephemeris quality, and using triple frequency band pseudo-range and carrier phase measurements will potentially make robust standalone solution to converge to the sub decimeter level of accuracy for most part of outdoor navigation applications. Assisted GNSS expands its capabilities to harsh conditions, but nevertheless GNSS is blind in deep indoor environments. So other approaches to positioning have been proposed for indoor navigation. One of most widely used approaches is based on using 802.11 Wi-Fi. It allows for obtaining of low cost location solution using already deployed access points (AP) just modifying firmware part of the system. Received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is widely used in navigation equations as raw measurements the same way as pseudo-ranges are used in satellites navigation equations. But, classic logarithmic loss function connecting distance to AP with RSSI readings can be used only in ideal environments, free of sources of fading and multipath. Understanding of this disadvantage gave rise of using fingerprint-based methods, connecting samples (or fingerprints) of RSSI measurements with certain calibration (or anchor) points whose precise position is stored in the calibration database together with RSSI fingerprint vectors.},

On the other hand, a much smaller number of them is usually sufficient to achieve necessary precision of positioning. Also, some parts of RTK algorithms, like carrier phase ambiguity resolution, are very sensitive to the problem dimension as they include the integer search. To reduce computational cost of positioning, the optimal choice of signals involved in computations should be performed. The PDOP or GDOP criterion is often used as a cost function to be optimized. Optimization is constrained by given number of satellite signals to be chosen for processing. This optimization problem falls into class of binary optimization problems which are hard for precise solution. The semi-definite relaxation approach (see [1]) is proposed in the paper for approximate solution of this problem. Computational results illustrating good performance of the proposed approach complete the paper.},

The reference signals (RSs) of modern OFDM-based systems contain both always-on and on-demand components. These components can be unknown and subject to dynamic transmission modes. Thanks to a matched subspacebased detection algorithm, the proposed receiver is shown to be capable of cognitive detection of both always-on and ondemand components in the Starlink OFDM-based RSs. It is shown that despite the dynamic nature of Starlink RSs, the proposed matched subspace detector senses the transition between the transmission modes of Starlink RSs, and detects all the accessible RSs with a predetermined probability of false alarm. Experimental results are provided to validate the performance of the proposed receiver in transmission mode detection in Starlink downlink signals.},

The situations of interest are when map only constrains the single side of the particle cloud. This occurs when a pedestrian moves along a wall in a wide corridor, or in a room where the outer wall is the only feature constraining the pedestrian’s motion. Current PF weight update methods shift the mean of the particle distribution away from the wall towards open space. This produces an undesired estimate that introduces drift into the position solution. The proposed method seeks to reduce this error to improve the navigation solution.

This paper addresses the challenges associated with designing a message for the L5 Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) ephemeris and almanac data which can handle this broad spectrum of proposed orbital regimes. In the past, the MOPS message used Earth fixed Cartesian position, velocity, and acceleration (9 degrees-of-freedom (DOF)) to describe the motion of the geostationary (GEO) SBAS satellites. The proposed next generation MOPS message will have to be much more sophisticated in order to encompass potential navigation and augmentation satellites ranging from GSO to LEO. A method of optimally fitting orbital elements has been devised which allows for a wide variety of orbital elements to be employed. With this, a 9 DOF set of orbital elements has been selected for the ephemeris message and a 7 DOF set for the almanac which function amicably for the range of orbits in question. Case studies show the effectiveness of the proposed message for GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, WAAS, EGNOS, QZSS, Iridium, and other proposed orbits such as Molniya. Quantization and detailed message structure will also be discussed.},

  abstract = {Autonomous vehicles are being deployed with a spectrum of capability, extending from driver assistance features for the highway in personal vehicles (SAE Level 2+) to fully autonomous fleet ride sharing services operating in complex city environments (SAE Level 4+). This spectrum of autonomy often operates in different physical environments with different degrees of assumed driver in-the-loop oversight and hence have very different system and subsystem requirements. At the heart of SAE Level 2 to 5 systems is localization and mapping, which ranges from road determination for feature geofencing or highlevel routing, through lane determination for advanced driver assistance, to where-in-lane positioning for full vehicle control. We assess localization and mapping requirements for different levels of autonomy and supported features. This work provides a framework for system decomposition, including the level of redundancy needed to achieve the target level of safety. We examine several representative autonomous and assistance features and make recommendations on positioning requirements as well map georeferencing and information integrity.},

  abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) brought navigation to the masses. Coupled with smartphones, the blue dot in the palm of our hands has forever changed the way we interact with the world. Looking forward, cyber-physical systems such as self-driving cars and aerial mobility are pushing the limits of what localization technologies including GNSS can provide. This autonomous revolution requires a solution that supports safety-critical operation, centimeter positioning, and cybersecurity for millions of users. To meet these demands, we propose a navigation service from Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites which deliver precision in-part through faster motion, higher power signals for added robustness to interference, constellation autonomous integrity monitoring for integrity, and encryption / authentication for resistance to spoofing attacks. This paradigm is enabled by the ‘New Space’ movement, where highly capable satellites and components are now built on assembly lines and launch costs have decreased by more than tenfold. Such a ubiquitous positioning service enables a consistent and secure standard where trustworthy information can be validated and shared, extending the electronic horizon from sensor line of sight to an entire city. This enables the situational awareness needed for true safe operation to support autonomy at scale.},

These range from a need for road determination ({$<$}5 meters), lane determination ({$<$}1.5 meters), and determining where the vehicle is within the lane ({$<$}0.3 meters). This work examines the performance of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) on 30,000 km of North American highways to better understand the automotive positioning needs it meets today and what might be possible in the near future with wide area GNSS correction services and multi-frequency receivers. This includes data from a representative automotive production GNSS used primarily for turn-by-turn navigation as well as an Inertial Navigation System which couples two survey grade GNSS receivers with a tactical grade Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to act as ground truth. The latter utilized networked Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GNSS corrections delivered over a cellular modem in real-time. We assess on-road GNSS accuracy, availability, and continuity. Availability and continuity are broken down in terms of satellite visibility, satellite geometry, position type (RTK fixed, RTK float, or standard positioning), and RTK correction latency over the network. Results show that current automotive solutions are best suited to meet road determination requirements at 98\% availability but are less suitable for lane determination at 57\%. Multi-frequency receivers with RTK corrections were found more capable with road determination at 99.5\%, lane determination at 98\%, and highway-level lane departure protection at 91\%.},

The reception of signals is possible all around the world except in urban areas where conditions are harsh and disturb the positioning result. We have implemented a self-consistent approach to detect NLOS in the measurement domain and use the information for the position estimation process. Our algorithm requires neither additional information from other sources (for example, correction services for RTK, or maps with different features) nor special sensors such as cameras to extend the field of view.},

  abstract = {In the most common method of commercial composting, bio-waste is stacked into triangle-shaped windrows. As oxygen is needed for the composting process, the windrows need to be turned repeatedly by compost turners with spiked drums. The biogenic material has to be turned at low speeds and during the turning process, the drivers are exposed to water vapor, gases and high temperatures. Due to these unpleasant working conditions, operators of large composting plants often have difficulty in finding personnel. Therefore, autonomous compost turners would be a great benefit for operators of composting plants. A prerequisite for an autonomous compost turner is a robust and reliable positioning algorithm which is capable of providing continuous and precise position, velocity and attitude information of the compost turner in real-time. This paper presents a positioning module for tracked compost turners. It gives an overview on the system design and evaluates which sensors can be used for positioning of compost turners based on tests in the environment of a real composting site. Based on the preliminary sensor tests, a set of suitable navigation sensors is selected. The selected sensors include a GNSS dual-antenna array, a stereo camera, a MEMS IMU and encoders. The images recorded by the stereo camera are fused with a precise 3D map. Within this paper, a federated loosely coupled extended Kalman filter is developed to fuse the result of the stereo-image and model matching with GNSS, INS and odometer measurements. The primary innovation lies in the sensor selection and sensor fusion specifically tailored to compost turners. A novel approach, which fuses GNSS, INS, odometer, stereo images and a 3D map, is presented.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, high-accuracy GNSS has played an increasingly important role in the agricultural sector. However, when used as a stand-alone sensor for positioning, GNSS cannot meet the requirements of autonomous agricultural machinery. To ensure high availability, robustness and increased accuracy of position and attitude, new sensor fusion concepts tailored to agricultural applications must be developed. The paper presents two sensor fusion algorithms for tracked agricultural vehicles. The first one is an error-state cascaded integration which uses GNSS, Odometry, and Visual Odometry (VO), paired with a point cloud registration algorithm called Normal distributions Transform (NDT), as aiding sensors and the IMU as reference sensor. The second consists of two local error-state filters, one for GNSS/INS fusion and the other for fusing VO/NDT and Odometry, where the result of the local filters is combined in a snapshot fusing algorithm. To find out which integration architecture is best suited for tracked agricultural vehicles like compost turners, the filters are tested at a composting site and evaluated regarding their achievable real-time accuracy for position and attitude. The results show that both filters achieve sub-decimetre accuracy for the positioning solution, but the cascaded integration architecture is more robust against outliers.},

These theoretical bounds are obtained for channel models including line-of-sight (LOS) and multipath propagation in presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), with parametrization based on the 3GPP standardization. Because 5G NR physical layer (PHY) simulations are complex and time consuming, a simple CRLB model for TOA estimation is instead here proposed, based on pre-computed tables for certain propagation conditions, SNR levels and transmit signal configuration. The proposed model can be understood as a generalization of the well-known closed-form expression of the CRLB for TOA estimation for pure LOS channels (i.e. with no multipath propagation) to the case of LOS channels with multipath propagation. System-level simulations are then performed in order to validate the proposed CRLB model for TOA estimation and to assess the 5G NR downlink time-difference of arrival (TDOA) positioning capabilities.},

The self-learning fingerprinting matching approach presented in this paper is a new strategy to reduce the labor and time consuming system training. Continuous training is performed instead of a dedicated training phase before positioning of a user is possible. Verified RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) scans made by the users’ mobile device are then included into the fingerprinting database and continuously update the system. Due to this continuous system training spatial and temporal RSSI variations can be accommodated and modelled. With this approach a significant increase in localization accuracy and performance is achieved. Tests in a multi-storey office environment and a two storey residential apartment as well as a medical praxis showed matching rates of over 90 \% for the localization of the mobile user in a certain room.},

  abstract = {Some of the biggest investments surrounding Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers are the development and integration of adaptive nulling technology. Researchers, developers, and integrators need to understand the effects these nulling technologies have on the navigation receivers and systems using the modified RF output, and their ability to suppress undesired signals. Due to the sensitive nature of the GNSS spectrum, outdoor testing of Anti-Jam (AJ) electronics and Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (CRPA) technologies are difficult, expensive, and often cause schedule delay. It is becoming more important to develop cost effective means to evaluate adaptive nulling advancements and their effects on the receivers with which they are being integrated. Aside from open air testing, this evaluation and integration is best accomplished through modeling and simulation techniques. This paper investigates a method of using a Steiner tree model to relate the per-element phase errors of a simulated wavefront and their effect at the system level. Theory developed [1] to expand the possible angle of arrival (AoA) simulation options through a series of untraditional tap selections will be implemented in a series of digital and hardware simulations.},

The proposed method is to store short sequences of SCE PRN code chips on the user receiver before the mission. These SCE PRN code chips allow the user receiver to calculate at pre-defined points in time a secure and trustable SCE PVT position. Since no communication channel is required, this method mitigates the risk that hostile forces may try to jam the UAV’s radio control. Moreover, radio silence can be realized, which is beneficial or even required for some missions. After a comparison with alternative SCE GNSS serverbased techniques, the new architecture of such a system is described together with some first proof-of-concept results and an assessment about the potential security risks behind such a solution.},

  abstract = {Attitude is an important consideration for aircraft due to its necessity for control and other purposes such as remote sensing. Sensor fusion techniques are a popular approach to attitude estimation since low-cost and lightweight sensors such as inertial sensors can be utilized. However, an additional source of information that has been mostly overlooked is the control inputs. This information is typically known, and when coupled with an aircraft dynamic model, can predict the aircraft states. This information when fused with other sensor measurements through Kalman filtering techniques offers a reasonable method for using all available information to predict aircraft attitude. This work presents the procedure for implementing this sensor fusion idea with some simulation results from a known aircraft dynamic model.},

  abstract = {In most areas of application of GNSS positioning the use of standalone calculation or loosely coupling is sufficient. With high-end GNSS receivers and high-precision IMUs these algorithms provide a good performance as long as the availability of satellites is adequate. Using GPS gives this condition in many cases. In the automotive area several challenges arise: Urban canyons cause shadowing effects and multipath errors. Besides the receiver and sensors must be affordable and in the line with the budget of vehicle production. So this work investigates the performance improvement of a tightly coupled algorithm using multi-GNSS instead of using only one system. Further it evaluates the approach of a modular update routine. This modularization enables the independent update of different parts of system state vector. To use multi-GNSS separate clock error estimation for each system is made. In the process of evaluation the different position results are compared with broadcast intersystem bias (ISB) where possible.},

  abstract = {With GNSS as flagship, space-based PNT enables the single largest downstream space sector, worth about €150 billion annually and growing at the rate of 10 per cent per year [29]. The associated infrastructures (e.g. Galileo, GPS) are evolving and introducing new capabilities to meet more demanding needs, in a context of hybrid and system-of-systems PNT solutions. Meanwhile, PNT solutions which exploit signals from LEO (what is being called LEO-PNT) are emerging as a major trend of evolution for space-based PNT, backed by the benefits of multi-layer architectures and new industrial and business models in the Space sector (the so-called New Space). Many initiatives are now being taken worldwide, driven either by institutional or commercial stakes. Europe is taking part to the evolution of this landscape, supported by solid industrial grounds in New Space capabilities and PNT technologies, as well as by institutional initiatives. For instance, the proposal for a regulation of the European Union to establish IRIS² (“Infrastructure for Resilience, Interconnection \& Security by Satellites”) refers to LEO-PNT as potential non-communication mission. In this context, this paper provides an overview of the current initiatives, and in particular, objectives, opportunities, trade-offs and possible solutions for LEO-PNT in the context of evolutions of European space-based infrastructures. The scope comprises an overview of the global LEO-PNT landscape, and in particular of the European one, for both purpose-built LEOPNT and more opportunistic approaches such as the integration of PNT capabilities in existing or future satcom signals (e.g. 5G NTN). Possible use cases leveraging LEO-PNT are presented together with the associated design drivers and technologies, trade-offs and some examples of working points illustrating the differentiators of LEO-PNT in augmenting and complementing European GNSS capabilities. Technological enablers on the payload side as well as on the user side are addressed and discussed, based on ongoing studies and proof-of-concept developments, as well as incoming opportunities, such as the LEO-PNT In-Orbit Demonstrator under preparation.},

  abstract = {This paper assesses the potential benefits of applying online integrity monitoring to aviation software. Traditionally, safety analyses for software components of aviation systems have been conducted differently than safety analyses for electrical and mechanical components. In particular, software verification and validation are typically conducted in advance of system deployment, via exhaustive testing. Though software bugs occasionally impact fielded aviation systems, system fault trees do not typically assign failure probabilities to software components. Moreover, online signal monitoring techniques are not generally applied to detect software-system anomalies, also known as bugs. As software complexity increases, and as interactions between software and physical system components become more complex and situational, it is prudent to consider whether exhaustive pre-service software testing is sufficient to maintain system safety, and whether techniques used to evaluate safety for hardware components (e.g. fault trees and monitoring) might be applied to software components to enhance system safety and mitigate the burden of exhaustive software testing. The primary contribution of this paper is to propose an architecture for online bug monitoring and to quantify its potential to relax requirements for pre-service verification without sacrificing overall system safety.},

  abstract = {This paper analyzes the integrity risk allocation for automated driving applications involving lane keeping, with an emphasis on converting a risk-per-mile specification into a riskper-event specification. The integrity risk allocation is the basis for defining a confidence bound (or protection level) for the navigation sensor error (NSE) distribution. For the vehicle to operate safely, the protection level must not exceed the alert limit, a geometric bound that specifies the worst-case tolerable error. In this comparison, the NSE distribution describes the range of values expected from the random error at a particular instant. However, safety targets are typically quoted on a per-mile or per-hour basis. Thus, research is needed to determine the frequency per mile (or hour) of independent events that cause a loss of integrity. This paper models lane keeping in two-way traffic to estimate, for that use case, the rate of occurrence of hazardous events. We combine these models with 2019 data for a particular road segment (part of MA Route 16). For that roadway, we estimate an events/mile rate of 19 in heavy traffic, 0.27 in low traffic, with a mean of 9.5 averaged over a typical weekday.},

  abstract = {GNSS positioning with high Integrity and accuracy attributes is a key application for implementing more efficient and safer automated train systems. The goal is an overall system concept and train equipment that is competent in high multipath environments, suitable for being integrated into the train safe platform ensuring at the same time economy on total cost of operations. Connected cars applications rely also on accurate and safe positioning and have in common with the trains the operational environment and a centralized command and control system. This paper introduce the give and take paradigm to liaise train control systems and autonomous cars stake holders and develop a common GNSS platform. The ambition is to export to the autonomous cars the safety capabilities of train control systems demonstrated during tens of years of operations, and to exploiting the large car’s market potential to lower the GNSS platform costs. The paper starts with the characteristics of the European Railways Train Management Systems (ERTMS) that guarantees the highest safety levels through a platform which is interoperable, standard and certifiable with harmonized procedures. Then we describe the plan to validate and certify the GNSS positioning applications into the ERTMS, which is one of the Game Changer technologies of the ERTMS evolution plan. The synergy with the connected cars is discussed by first introducing the virtual track concept to drive a car on the road as a train on the railways and then by developing the virtual horizon to safely monitor the way ahead detecting obstacles. The roadmap is driven by the ERSAT GGC (Galileo Game Changer) H2020 project, involving the rail community, and the EMERGE initiative, dealing with the automotive sector.},

  abstract = {Alternative solutions for navigating in challenging environments are in high demand as traditional methods are proving to be inadequate and/or easily manipulated in unfavorable situations. These methods are of particular interest in automated ground vehicle platoons due to their ability to aid and strengthen, or revamp pre-existing navigation systems entirely. Automated platoons benefit from these methods as they improve positioning capabilities required by autonomous following vehicles to accurately follow or duplicate the path of a human driven lead vehicle. There currently exist numerous platooning methods that utilize ground vehicle-based GPS/GNSS, UWB, lidar, radar and cameras. Unfortunately, the sensors used in these ground-based solutions suffer from sensor-specific deficiencies such as degraded, interfered, and unavailable signals, multipath, noise, etc. In addition, issues arise when a clear LOS cannot be established between vehicles forming the platoon. This thesis aims to address these shortcomings by leveraging visual information of the automated platoon provided by a gimballed, downward-facing monocular camera fixed to a multi-rotor UAV. Three methods utilizing the UAV’s bird’s-eye view are developed in this work; the first being a method for geo-localizing detected and tracked ground vehicles from a GPS/GNSS-aided UAV. Accurate global or relative positioning of the ground vehicles is a requirement for successfully implementing an automated ground vehicle platoon. This method explores the ability of employing an automated platoon utilizing indirect estimates of the ground vehicles’ global positions. By using measurements of the UAV’s GPS position, compass heading, and relative altitude (AGL), the aerial camera’s intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, and measurements of the pixel location of the vehicles in the aerial imagery, an estimate of the ground vehicles’ global positions within a local navigation frame can be determined. The described method can extend positioning capabilities when GPS/GNSS signals are unobtainable by the ground vehicles but available to the UAV. While no filtering, state estimation or DGPS/DRTK techniques are applied, the algorithm is shown to be most effective under small changes in the UAV’s pose with global positioning accuracy of two ground vehicles in the range of \textasciitilde 2-3m. Normal motions of the UAV is shown to increase global positioning inaccuracy north of \textasciitilde 5-7m. While this is the case, it is recognized that positioning errors across multiple tracked vehicles are affected in a similar manner. This phenomenon is comparable to multiple GPS receivers within close proximity that are affected by similar atmospheric and ephemeris errors. As a result, relative positioning between two ground vehicles is investigated in which relative positioning error is in the range of \textasciitilde 1m despite normal UAV maneuvers. The second method investigates ground vehicle relative positioning for automated platoons using aerial imagery exclusively. This method can facilitate LOS vehicle following and non-LOS path-duplication for an automated ground vehicle platoon using only the UAV’s AGL, the aerial camera’s intrinsic, and the location and heading of the tracked vehicles in the aerial imagery. The algorithm does not depend on global positioning, therefore offering a GPS/GNSS independent navigation solution for the automated platoon. Following accuracy is analyzed based on the lateral path error of an autonomous following vehicle replicating the path of a human driven lead vehicle for the two platooning methods. LOS vehicle following demonstrates lateral path accuracy less than 0.5m for close distance straight line driving maneuvers. Following accuracy decreases through circular or turning maneuvers especially with increasing separation distance between the vehicles. Non-LOS path-duplication demonstrates lateral path accuracy in the range of 5-6m for normal driving maneuvers and less than 2m for coordinated maneuvers. When utilizing relative positioning for path-duplication, accurate estimates of the following vehicle’s odometry is required for path management and dead reckoning. While ground vehicle-based sensors exist to obtain odometry information, the technology may not always be accessible. Therefore, the final method presents an aerial vision-based speed estimation algorithm for estimating the speed of the ground vehicles. Analysis is conducted on the method’s usability to support a real-time implementation of an automated ground vehicle platoon. Specifically, the analysis is focused on the algorithm’s effectiveness in reducing the reliance on the following vehicle’s INS used for path management and dead-reckoning purposes when implementing path duplication. Average velocity error across multiple post processed experimental runs is less than 1 m/s, however, computing power is a concerning limitation that can limit real-time implementation and replace the following vehicle’s INS.},

  abstract = {GNSS positioning applications expect phasetracking loops to be more and more robust to ensure a user precise positioning in challenging environments such as urban canyons or under ionospheric scintillations. Classical GNSS phase tracking loops, generally based on closed architecture schemes, are not able to meet the expected robustness requirements . Phase tracking suffer from a lack of robustness due to the cycle slips phenomenon resulting from the ambiguous nature of the phase measurements. Closed loops are very sensible to cycle slips due to the presence of the estimation feedback step which propagates errors inside the loop. On the other hand, open loops can perform robust phase tracking in harsh environments because they don’t propagate any errors during the recursive phase estimation. This article presents a new open loop architecture for robust phase tracking. By using circular models for phase measurements, the proposed open loop is able to deal with the ambiguous nature of the phase to be tracked. The performances of the proposed architecture had been assessed under low C/N0 conditions and under ionospheric scintillations. Compared to performances of classical DPLLs, the proposed loop offers a better robustness in terms of loss of lock probability even if results showed that some additional studies are necessary to improve the cycle slips rate.},

The work started with an initial two months monitoring campaign in 2013, followed by a few shorter monitoring campaigns up through 2017. From January 2018 the system has been monitoring continuously, but the presented results cover only data up to the end of 2019. The extracted trend data show that the number of intentional jammers have increased from 2013 and up to 2018, but indicate a significant reduction in 2019. One potential reason for the reduction in 2019 can be that GPS jammers had a rising interest in the Norwegian media in the first quarter of 2019, leading to increased public awareness of the illegality of jamming and the potential to be caught if using jammers. The detections, including both intentional and non-intentional interference, are relatively equally distributed among the different vehicles, however the detections that are likely to originate from intentional GNSS jammers are mainly found in trucks and vans, often marked with a company logo.},

  abstract = {One usual assumption in the high-dynamics GNSS tracking literature is that the GNSS signal is received without multipath. A lot of research has been conducted to mitigate the adverse multipath effects in GNSS receivers, but addressed mainly at the code tracking stage and considering static multipath models. However, in dynamic environments the nature of multipath is substantially different since the Doppler affecting each path can be different, and this can severely affect not only code but carrier tracking. In this work, a post-correlation GNSS signal model is presented to account for the dynamic multipath scenario characterized by a receiver acceleration step, i.e. a linearly changing Doppler frequency. The proposed signal model allows to easily analyze tracking loop behavior in an early design stage and therefore to predict the tracking loop performance with and without multipath presence. This model also shows that the perturbation produced by multipath during an acceleration step has a chirp-like behavior, a fact that can be used to design more robust carrier tracking schemes. In particular, a novel approach based on an additional non-linear filtering stage inside the loop able to mitigate this perturbation is presented and characterized by means of Monte Carlo simulations.},

  abstract = {Critical railway systems, like signalling or automatic train control (ATC), are envisioned to rely on satellite-based localization. The safety aspect requires that the localization system does not only provide accurate information but also proper error uncertainty estimation and integrity quantification. This is challenging to be achieved for railway applications, since the environment is very complex and GNSS is typically affected by multiple local threats. In particular, multipath must be carefully modelled. In this work, we present a methodology to obtain a robust multipath error model for GNSS code observations that is adapted to each position along the railway track map. The method relies on the fact that the position of the train is constraint to the tracks and therefore the location specific impact of the environment is repeatable. The error model is therefore obtained and tested in this paper by the accumulation of data over several train runs collected with dedicated real measurement campaigns. The multipath error bounding capability is evaluated by using a modified horizontal ARAIM (H-ARAIM) adapted for the railway environment. Results show that the map-based error model can enable safe error quantification, in particular in challenging scenarios.},

For a combination of power and signal distortion metrics the worst case PMD is reduced by 60\%. We then calibrate measurement models for a receiver model based on flight data and validate compliance with the false alert guarantee for power and a signal distortion metric as well as pseudorange residuals. We apply the framework using the calibrated models to spoofing scenarios from the TEXBAT dataset processed through the same receiver type. We demonstrate highly robust detection behavior by leveraging the framework to combine the three metrics.},

  abstract = {Navigation integrity is a well-established concept in the aviation domain. Motivated by the increased research on autonomy across all transportation sectors, integrity algorithms are now being explored for new use cases and measurement types. The attempt generally is to pair Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and measurements from other sensors, such as a camera or signals of opportunity. Two conflicting aspects make this a very challenging problem. On the one hand, tighter protection levels are demanded than those currently available in aviation. On the other hand, these new types of measurements have been less well studied than those from GNSS signals. In addition, they are often received in challenging environments such as urban areas, making it significantly more challenging to bound the errors tails. In this paper, we attempt to identify how this gap between demanded performance and less reliable ranging measurements from fifth generation (5G) cellular networks can be closed. First, we show how to include measurements from non-GNSS sources (i.e., 5G) into a well-established integrity algorithm. We then present a parametric study showing the effect of varying key parameters in the integrity algorithm, such as the measurement’s nominal distribution, the probabilities that this nominal distribution is not valid, as well as the continuity and integrity requirements. Our results provide guidance on acceptable values for the nominal measurement model, they indicate that fault rates have to be kept below 10−4 and that a relaxation of the integrity requirement can result in significantly tighter protection levels.},

  abstract = {Satellite navigation signals demodulation performance is historically tested and compared in the Additive White Gaussian Noise propagation channel model which well simulates the signal reception in open areas. Nowadays, the majority of new applications targets dynamic users in urban environments; therefore the GNSS signals demodulation performance has become mandatory to be provided in urban environments. The GPS L1C signal demodulation performance in urban environments is thus provided in this paper. To do that, a new methodology adapted to provide and assess GNSS signals demodulation performance in urban channels has been developed. It counteracts the classic method limitations which are the fluctuating received C/N0 in urban environments and the fact that each received message is taken into account in the error rate computation whereas in GNSS it is not necessary. The new methodology thus proposes to provide the demodulation performance for ‘favorable’ reception conditions together with statistical information about the occurrence of these favorable reception conditions. To be able to apply this new methodology and to provide the GPS L1C signal demodulation performance in urban environments, a simulator SiGMeP (Simulator for GNSS Message Performance) has been developed. Two urban propagation channel models can be tested: the narrowband Perez-Fontan/Prieto model and the wideband DLR model. Moreover, the impact of the received signal phase estimation residual errors has been taken into account (ideal estimation is compared with PLL tracking).},

The tracking algorithm is tested and validated in real-time scenarios, which includes a simulative GNSS environment in the laboratory, as well as outdoor testing, whereby the functionality of the system can be determined. In order to improve the robustness of the receiver an exploitation of the Direction of Arrival (DoA) measurements is implemented, which allows the exclusion of unauthentic or unwanted signals in the Kalman Filter updating process. An error vector based on comparison and statistically testing of the measured DoAs against the expected DoAs (Meurer et al., 2016), which can be obtained by geometric calculation of the receivers position and attitude, is generated and contains information about the credibility of each tracking channel. Manipulating the measurement covariance matrix of the central navigation Kalman filter with this error vector will decrease the contribution of incredible channels not only to the Position/Velocity/Timing (PVT) solution, but also to the tracking loops, because of the vector tracking feedback.},

In most environments a Global Positioning System (GPS)/inertial measurement unit combination along with an air data sytem can provide accurate navigation capability. However, this is not possible in urban corridors where GPS has well-documented degradation. Other sensors such as vision-based systems and Long-Term Evolution transceivers have shown to be useful in urban settings, but modeling them individually is difficult without an in-depth understanding of each sensor and the factors dictating its accuracy. This paper proposes a framework to model locationdependent accuracy of navigation and how this changes within the urban environment. Results show that persistent machine vision can provide accurate navigation capability, but LTE with its current measurement delay does not have a noticeable positive effect on navigation accuracy.},

A commercial multi-GNSS signal generator carries out real-world multiGNSS signals’ position and time spoofing. The devices under test are professional multi-GNSS receivers, partly equipped with the AtomiChron NMA and Galileo OSNMA service and Galileo public regulated service (PRS) for comparison. The results show that NMA, in general, is a valuable add-on for spoofing detection, especially if NMA is not only provided for Galileo as in OSNMA. Still, the latency to detect spoofing is in the area of tens of seconds. Therefore, a combination of different metrics, incl. NMA is strongly recommended for a GNSS receiver’s spoofing protection.},

  abstract = {A pedestrian navigation system has to be accurate, reasonably priced, easy to use and light to carry to be adopted into use. Smartphones are attractive platforms for the navigation systems due to their small size, low cost and diversity of sensors feasible for positioning. Pedestrian navigation is mostly needed in GNSS degraded and denied areas such as indoors and in urban canyons. Self-contained sensors function independently regardless of the environment by augmenting the radio positioning systems, like GPS or wireless radio sensors, using information of the motion of the user. The measurements from selfcontained sensors in a smartphone are, however, noisy and biased and thus need some aiding. This paper presents a method of using measurements from consecutive images as a gyroscope and an odometer. The rotation of the camera is calculated from vanishing points and the change in the heading angle used as a gyroscope measurement. Using the tilt obtained from the vanishing point calculations the distance to the objects in the navigation environment is observed and the translation between consecutive images measured with image homography from the image points of the objects. The translation measurements are then used as measurements from an odometer.},

  abstract = {Radio navigation is of utmost importance in several application fields. Nowadays, many civil and professional applications massively rely on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and related technologies to accurately estimate position and time. Existing GNSS-based systems are threatened by malicious attacks among which spoofing and meaconing constitute severe challenges to the receiver. Several of such GNSS systems constitute mass market applications and devices, and a threat to the GNSS receiver could have cascading effects at application levels and for interconnected systems. Networked GNSS receivers are in general ubiquitous because any receiver embedded in a complex system such as a smart device or smart connected cars can exploit network connectivity. This novel generation of valuable-performance GNSS receivers are prone both to standard RF spoofing attacks and to cyber-attacks conceived to hijack complex network based services such as DGNSS-based cooperative positioning. By means of a set of experimental tests, this paper highlights possible metrics to be checked to identify malicious attacks to the positioning and navigation systems in mass market connected devices. The network-based exchange of GNSS data such as GNSS raw measurements recently disclosed in Android smart devices is conceived in this work to offer the possibility to compare or combine such metrics to better identifies spoofing and meaconing attacks.},

  abstract = {For navigation problems involving dead reckoning of odometry measurements aided with additional sensors, we introduce a method that treats the lateral components of the odometry measurements as constraints, thereby reducing the dimensionality of the state representation. The constrained lateral motion approach is best suited for factor graph representations of ground vehicle and fixed-wing aerial vehicle navigation, whereby the tangential component of motion is typically much greater than the lateral component. We conduct experiments in both 2D and 3D cooperative navigation scenarios aided by inter-vehicle range measurements, and show that we achieve faster convergence with more efficient optimization with our new parameterization.},

  abstract = {Urban navigation applications, e.g., autonomous driving, require high quality in terms of accuracy and integrity. The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) sensor is the only one providing absolute positioning information and thus the demand of high accuracy and high precision GNSS-based positioning models is increasing. In order to reach centimeter to decimeter accuracy, e.g., for lane level accuracy applications, carrier-phase based positioning techniques have to be used. The main error source of GNSS positioning in urban environments is non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signal reception, leading to potentially unbounded and positive ranging errors. One widely used method to mitigate multipath errors is 3D Mapping-Aided (3DMA) GNSS. Using the information from building models, NLOS signals can be identified and consequently excluded from the positioning algorithm. On the other hand, outlier detection approaches are implemented in positioning algorithms to detect and exclude faulty GNSS measurements from the estimation process in an iterative manner. The impact of 3DMA-FDE techniques and outlier detection is already widely developed and analyzed in terms of pseudorange-based GNSS positioning for urban navigation. However, a detailed exploration of these methods implemented in carrier-phase based GNSS positioning is not yet fully exploited. We study the assessed performance of both approaches in static and kinematic GNSS real-time-kinematic (RTK)positioning. In static applications, the 3DMA-FDE approach outperforms the outlier detection strategy in terms of convergence time, accuracy (float root mean squared errors (RMSE) are halved) and ambiguity fixing rate (7 \% compared to 88 \%). Based on a kinematic experiment, we show that the most accurate result is achieved by a combined solution. We obtain float RMSE of 64 cm, 60 cm and 81 cm in north, east and up direction, respectively. Using the ambiguity dilution-of-precision (ADOP) and ratio test values, we show that reliable ambiguity fixing is not possible due to poor geometry and observation quality. Finally, we show that our recently presented GNSS Feature Map can help to avoid computationally intensive operations at the rover due to epoch-wise ray tracing. Using a precomputed 5 m grid of way points, each containing ray tracing information in a 360◦×90◦ grid, a classification accuracy of 95 \% is achieved resulting in a very similar positioning performance.},

In addition, bounds on the determinant of the observability matrix are derived. The relationship between the satellite’s relative orbital inclination angle and geometric diversity of the line-of-sight vectors from the receiver to the satellite is analyzed, leading to geometric interpretations indicating directions of poor observability.

  abstract = {Inertial navigation provides a small footprint, lowpower, and low-cost pathway for localization in GPS-denied environments on extremely resource-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) platforms. Traditionally, application-specific heuristics and physics-based kinematic models are used to mitigate the curse of drift in inertial odometry. These techniques, albeit lightweight, fail to handle domain shifts and environmental non-linearities. Recently, deep neural-inertial sequence learning has shown superior odometric resolution in capturing non-linear motion dynamics without human knowledge over heuristic-based methods. These AI-based techniques are data-hungry, suffer from excessive resource usage, and cannot guarantee following the underlying system physics. This paper highlights the unique methods, opportunities, and challenges in porting real-time AIenhanced inertial navigation algorithms onto IoT platforms. First, we discuss how platform-aware neural architecture search coupled with ultra-lightweight model backbones can yield neuralinertial odometry models that are 31-134× smaller yet achieve or exceed the localization resolution of state-of-the-art AI-enhanced techniques. The framework can generate models suitable for locating humans, animals, underwater sensors, aerial vehicles, and precision robots. Next, we showcase how techniques from neurosymbolic AI can yield physics-informed and interpretable neural-inertial navigation models. Afterward, we present opportunities for fine-tuning pre-trained odometry models in a new domain with as little as 1 minute of labeled data, while discussing inexpensive data collection and labeling techniques. Finally, we identify several open research challenges that demand careful consideration moving forward.},

  abstract = {The high increase of safety critical applications such as autonomous driving, Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS), Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) and many applications that can cause human or economic losses pose a significant challenge of navigation integrity. Although the integrity concept is not new, a major challenge in these applications is to ensure both high accuracy and high integrity in very challenging environments. In response to the high requirements of these applications, this paper will present a high integrity multi-sensor navigation system specially designed for safety critical applications. The system is composed of a MEMS Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a multi-constellation multi-frequency GNSS receiver and an odometer communicating via a CAN bus. A tightly coupled solution [1] based on an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) has been developed by SBG-Systems to fuse all these sensors to deliver a high accuracy and availability especially in complex environments where satellites signals are prone to attenuation or even unavailability. In addition, advanced vehicle modeling and constraints [2] have been added with respect to the motion profile to provide a navigation solution for the targeted applications. The integrity management starts with the correction service such as the State Space Representation Corrections (SSR) [3]; many services now provide SSR corrections over the world with integrity messages. Another challenging aspect of robust navigation is the integration of an Advanced Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (ARAIM) [4], which can be defined as a two steps process. First, a Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) is performed, then if a consistent solution is found the Protection Levels (PL) are calculated [5]. The system will assure a continuous monitoring of multiple integrity indicator, the PL will be computed and compared to an Alert Limit (AL) threshold to notify the user about system availability. During the GNSS outages, the INS and the odometer not only keep the precision of the position solution, but also scale and propagate the PL using the inertial models [6]. This paper also focuses on the integrity assessment of the developed system. Indeed, an extensive test campaign has been conducted to evaluate the maturity of the technology and its compliance with autonomous vehicles requirements. Several ranges of products and configurations are tested to measure the performance driving factors and evaluate the typical use case.},

Though GBAS approach service type (GAST) C is operational in the mid-latitude region in the world, ionospheric issues prevent GAST C from full availability. In this study, possible use of GAST D for CAT I operation is examined. The GAST D protection levels in all the analyzed cases were below the vertical alert limit of 10 m. However, the airborne satellite geometry screening degraded the CAT I availability for the cases with the 𝐸!" parameter, which is the maximum range error assured by the ground subsystem, greater than 2.75m. Two potential approaches to relax the threshold value in the airborne satellite geometry screening (limit𝑆\#\$\%\&2) are considered. One is to set a larger max𝐸\# value, which is the maximum allowed vertical error, for CAT I operation in the airborne receiver in addition to that for CAT II/III operation, and the other is to deflate the broadcast 𝐸!" value. While the first approach is straight forward but requires airborne receiver standard changes, the second approach requires changes in the broadcast parameter only. When the deflated 𝐸!" is broadcast in the second approach, CAT II/III operations must be prohibited. Nevertheless, deflated 𝐸!" for CAT I could be beneficial, because the period of CAT II/III conditions are much less than the CAT I condition. Deflated and non-deflated 𝐸!" values could be used depending on the weather condition at the airport, if certain mechanism to notify aircraft on the supported approach operations.},

  abstract = {The sporadic E (Es) layer is an ionospheric layer with a high electron density and thin altitudinal thickness and appears at altitudes around 100 km. The density is sometimes so high that even VHF radio waves from the ground can be reflected and propagate beyond the radio horizon. It has been shown that aeronautical VHF navigation signals in the 108–118 MHz band can propagate beyond the radio horizon to cause potential interference. However, there has been little technique to monitor the Es layer in wide area. The fine structures of the Es layers which reflects the dynamics of the thermosphere has not been well understood yet. This study shows that the ROTI (rate of TEC index) map by utilizing dense GNSS observations is effective in detecting the Es layer at least in the daytime. The Es layer studies has a well-defined frontal structure, when ROTI values are mapped at the typical Es layer height (100 km). A methodology of detecting and characterizing the Es layer frontal structure without manual operation is developed by utilizing the Hough transformation, and the front direction and velocity are successfully derived. Utilizing the characteristics of the frontal structure, fine structures of the Es layer can be studied, and a couple of interesting features are found. However, this technique would not always be applicable. Application to a homogeneous Es layer and nighttime Es layer are challenging problems. Nevertheless, it is still very useful, and is suitable for automated real-time Es layer monitoring system in a wide area.},

  abstract = {The ionospheric anomaly monitor for the Dual Frequency Multi-Constellation (DFMC) Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) was tested by using the real Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data obtained under the ionospheric disturbances at Ishigaki (24.4N, 124.2E, corresponding to 19.7N in the magnetic latitude), Japan. We used data obtained on 1 November 2021 when multiple plasma bubbles were observed to test the ionospheric anomaly monitor. We tested ionospheric delay difference (dI) estimation methods based on the single-frequency smoothed (SFS) pseudoranges, divergence-free smoothed (DFS) pseudoranges, and carrier-phase (CP). Two smoothing time constants of 100 and 600 seconds were compared. When the ionospheric gradient of 230 mm/km was observed for the GPS PRN27 satellite, the dI estimation by DFS with the smoothing time constant of 600 seconds outperformed the SFS with 100 seconds. SFS with a longer time constant (600 seconds) showed dI variation but with the opposite sign as those of CP and DFS. The smoothing time constant of 100 seconds was not enough for both DFS and SFS to distinguish the ionospheric anomaly from multipath. For the analyzed case, DFS with 600 seconds showed good performance. Recursive leveling of dI estimated by CP showed good convergence with dI as estimated with DFS.},

  abstract = {This thesis presents the use of a vehicle dynamic model (VDM) in conjunction with standard vehicle safety sensors to assist a low-cost Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and low-cost Global Positioning System (GPS) for fused precision ground vehicle navigation. Current production vehicles are out tted with a multitude of sensors that are essential to safety packages such as: Electronic Stability Control (ESC), navigation, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), and lane tracking. The research presented in this thesis focuses on the sensors used with ESC and navigation, i.e. Wheel Speed Sensors (WSS), Steer Angle Sensors (SAS), IMU, and GPS. Each of the proposed measurement systems is plagued with detrimental characteristics that prevent standalone high precision and robust ground vehicle localization. The bene ts of fusing GPS and an Inertial Navigation System (INS) are well documented, therefore a baseline GPS/INS localization algorithm based on well known literature is created. The benchmark system is used as a comparison medium in order to directly quantify performance of the localization algorithm utilizing VDM measurements. Initial research demonstrates improvements in performance of the GPS/INS/VDM localization algorithm over the benchmark GPS/INS algorithm. However, the GPS/INS/VDM algorithm demonstrates degraded performance in comparison to the GPS/INS algorithm during a few driving scenarios. A constant covariance for the VDM measurements in the EKF causes the localization algorithm to drift in moments of high dynamics. Further analysis of all measurement systems leads to the development of a Complementary Covariance Filter (CCF) for the VDM measurements that allows the localization algorithm to weight the VDM measurement update accordingly during periods of high dynamics. With the CCF improvements, the updated GPS/INS/VDM algorithm is able to achieve improved or at least equivalent performance over the baseline GPS/INS localization solution for all situations. This demonstrates that the inclusion of the VDM system along with ESC sensors provides an optimal low-cost ground vehicle localization solution when considering production cost and performance.},

  abstract = {Magnetic navigation requires the comparison of onboard magnetic sensor measurements to reference magnetic maps and models. Magnetic maps and models are available at a wide range of scales and scope. At any given location, measurements of the ambient magnetic field are the sum of various components, including sources internal and external to the Earth. This paper discusses maps and models of the internal components sourced in the core and lithosphere of the Earth. The long-wavelength, slowly-time-varying core field of the Earth is represented by global, satellite-based models. The timeinvariant lithospheric magnetic field is represented at its longest wavelengths by spherical harmonic models based on data from the CHAMP and SWARM satellite missions and at resolutions smaller than \textasciitilde 300 km by grid products based on the processing of airborne, marine, and ground surveys. Regional to local magnetic anomaly maps and grids are available for selected areas at resolutions down to 100 m. Evaluation of possible map/model performance for a given magnetic navigation scenario requires consideration of amplitude and frequency of magnetic field variations, and magnetic map/model uncertainty. We present a basic analysis of magnetic navigation signals as a function of altitude and velocity.},

  abstract = {Multi-sensor fusion is an inevitable part when designing an autonomous vehicle. The integration of measurements coming from different sensors has the advantage that the navigation system is more likely to provide a solution in a more varied range of scenarios. Due to the nature of the measurement principle of each sensor, the error dynamics are completely different and the strengths of a certain sensor compensate for the weaknesses of another. Nevertheless, in order to design and tune our navigation system according to the application we are targeting, it is needed to have a flexible framework where we can test different type of sensors, different sensor configurations, environments (urban, semi-urban, rural) and vehicle dynamics. Acquiring data from measurement campaigns is not only costly and time consuming, but usually one cannot have complete control of the environment and it is also challenging to acquire the ground truth data. For that reason, in this work, we present an extension to a previously introduced framework called SIMSS [1]. This framework is currently able to generate GNSS, IMU and LiDAR synthetic data and process it an RTK/INS/LiDAR loose coupled Kalman filter. In this work, we successfully show the quality of the generated synthetic data and the integration with our navigation modules within the MuSNAT. Hence demonstrating its use in testing and verification of our algorithms, which in turn gives us the opportunity to offer a more robust navigation system.},

For this reason, it is of our interest to continue the work of other researching groups (e.g. [1–5]) to characterize errors observed in the measurements of the LiDAR VLP-16. The present study shows the methodology we used to evaluate the performance of each laser channel and characterize them independently of each other. Furthermore, we evaluate the measurements of the sensor in a wide span of ranges, namely from 1 m to 20 m.

These SiS events are assessed by examining code and carrier phase measurements for a minimum set of IGS receivers worldwide distributed. Short duration (few seconds) satellite clock events are monitored using carrier measurements corrected by the geometric range and linearly interpolated precise satellite clocks at 300 seconds sampling rate. Pseudorange jumps are monitored with the code-minus-carrier combination, where the geometry and frequency dependent effects are removed. Events detected simultaneously on several receivers are recorded, while events that are not confirmed are discarded as receiver artefacts.},

  abstract = {A navigation framework with differential measurements from low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite signals of opportunity is presented. This framework comprises a navigating rover with unknown states and one or more base stations with known position(s). The framework fuses differenced pseudorange or Doppler measurements from the rover and base station(s) to LEO satellites with unkown states, in an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based tightly-coupled LEO-aided inertial navigation system (INS), while estimating the rover’s states simultaneously with the LEO satellites’ states. Simulations are conducted to analyze the navigation performance due to including a varying number of differential base stations. The simulations considered an aerial vehicle equipped with a tactical-grade inertial measurement unit (IMU), an altimeter, a GNSS receiver, and a LEO receiver making pseudorange and Doppler measurements to 14 Starlink LEO satellites. The vehicle-mounted receiver clock was assumed to be an oven-controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO), while the satellites were equipped with chip-scale atomic clocks (CSACs). The aerial vehicle navigated for 28 km in 300 seconds, the last 23 km of which are without GNSS. It is shown that despite relying on two-line element (TLE) files for the LEO ephemerides, which suffer from errors on the order of kilometers, the differential framework could achieve submeter-level accuracy when using pseudorange measurements. With 3 bases, the vehicle’s three-dimensional (3-D) position root mean-squared error (RMSE) drops dramatically, reaching a position RMSE of 28 cm when using pseudorange measurements and 1.94 m when using Doppler. Experimental results are presented for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigating for 2.28 km in 120 seconds, while utilizing differential carrier phase measurements from 2 Orbcomm LEO satellites. It is shown that using TLE+SGP4 for the LEO satellites’ ephemerides yields a 3-D position RMSE of 419 m, while the differential framework reduces it to 12.79 m.},

The GNSS may not provide accurate position or even go to complete outage for more than 15 mins in downtown cores or long tunnels; therefore, the Tethered positioning error can reach several hundred meters. While the land vehicles are supposed to travel on the roads, the feedback from a digital map can be used to constrain its position. This paper proposes a new method for tight integration of digital map and DR system (IMU/wheel odometer) to provide reliable navigation solutions in challenging GNSS environments for extended periods. A fuzzy logic map matching algorithm is utilized to identify the correct road link on which the vehicle moves. A feedback filter is designed to send a correct map matched position as well as the road link as measurement updates to the Kalman Filter (KF) of the Tethered positioning system. The proposed tight integration of digital map and DR system is evaluated using the datasets collected by Profound Positioning Inc. (PPI) in Calgary, AB, Canada. The results show the proposed method has an average of 0.15\% of relative horizontal position error for Calgary datasets, which shows considerable improvement over the Tethered solution only with 3.3\% of relative horizontal position error. The average azimuth error of the proposed system is 1.3 degrees, while the Tethered positioning system, which does not enjoy from road link azimuth feedback, shows an average azimuth error of 9.7 degrees.},

The algorithm processes measurement sets computed for each satellite, namely, carrier phase, pseudorange and carrier-to-noise ratio, creating clusters of consistent measurements, thus allowing the identification of satellite signals suffering from the multipath error. Since it is an unsupervised method, it overcomes one of the most limiting features of supervised algorithms that require training data sets a-priori obtained as representative of multipath and no-multipath conditions. The study exploits both the real GNSS data affected by the multipath in the surrounding environment that were collected at South African Antarctic research base SANAE-IV and the simulated data where the ionospheric, tropospheric and multipath errors are modelled. Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) algorithm with parity method was also implemented and tested for the same datasets, and it will be used as a term of comparison for the algorithm performance.},

Beyond the usual preliminary hard decision stage, which can mainly reject obvious outliers, our approach exploits machine learning to optimize the relative contributions from all available satellites feeding the positioning solver. For this, we construct a customized matrix of pseudorange residuals that is used as an input to the proposed longshort term memory neural network (LSTM NN) architecture. The latter is trained to predict several quality indicators that roughly approximate the standard deviations of pseudo-range errors, which are further integrated in the calculation of weights. Our numerical evaluations on both synthetic and real data show that the proposed solution is able to outperform conventional weighting and signal selection strategies from the state-of-theart, while fairly approaching optimal positioning accuracy.},

  abstract = {Positioning with Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in urban areas is still a challenging task. Obstacles in the vicinity of the antenna may block the Line-of-Sight (LOS) ray or degrade the signal resulting in lower signal strengths, signal interruptions and extra path delays of the signal. Ray tracing algorithms are therefore a commonly used 3D map aided (3DMA) approach to detect signals affected by the environment. Unlike signal reflection, diffraction is rarely considered as error source. A commonly used approach to mitigate the influence of diffracted signals on the position solution is the weighting of observations based on their Carrier-to-Noise Power Density Ratio (C/N0), e.g. by the SIGMA- model. However, in the case of diffraction of a LOS signal, the signal can be amplified, although the quality of the observation has decreased. Consequently, the C/N0 does not always provide reliable information about the quality of the signal. In this contribution, we present a detailed study of the behavior of diffraction in urban areas based on a Level of Detail (LoD)2 building model. A new layer is added to the existing classes of LOS, multipath (MP), Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) and blocked as well as the received signal strength is predicted. We validate our algorithm by both simulations and real data in static and kinematic scenarios. We show that diffraction affects all types of signal classes, resulting in extra path delays in cm-range and a loss in signal strength of up to 17 dB-Hz. Finally, an adapted weighting scheme is developed combining the SIGMA- model with ray tracing and diffraction modeling information. Its performance is tested in multi-GNSS Single Point Positioning (SPP) in a kinematic scenario in the city of Hannover. Our adapted weighting scheme delivers significant benefits in both 3D and 2D accuracy compared to the conventional SIGMAweighting. In urban trenches, combining the 8-class model with the C/N0 dependent SIGMA- model results in reductions of the RMSE of up to 20 \%. Large outliers in the positioning solution, especially for user positions in narrow urban trenches, could be drastically reduced using the combined weighting scheme.},

  abstract = {We consider the ability to determine position and motion precisely of a single LEO satellite carrying an RF receiver, without GNSS. Observables are RF (frequency) measurements of narrow band or unmodulated terrestrial beacons. We consider requirements such as LO frequency accuracy of 10-12 (relative deviation), position accuracy of 0.1 m, and velocity accuracy of 1 mm/sec. If GNSS were available, typical timing accuracy in space is around 10 ns and position accuracy is several meters at best – and therefore GNSS alone does not meet the time or space accuracy requirements. We also consider the case where GNSS is denied or otherwise unavailable. Critical issues are the stability of the local oscillators on board the spacecraft, the stability of the beacon frequencies, the accuracy of as-received frequency measurements, the spatial distributions of the beacons around the globe, and accuracy of the orbital propagation. As-emitted transmitter frequencies are not required to be known, except approximately so that the Doppler-shifted signals can be tuned. With accurate orbital modeling, and with an orbital average of 1 or 2 beacons in view, the single vehicle case supports position measurement accuracy better than what is obtainable with raw GNSS measurements. In the swarm case, when vehicle attitudes are measured accurately with star trackers and a sufficient quantity and quality of inter-vehicle measurements are available, the relative timing, positions and motions of the vehicles can be determined to greater precision than what is possible for a single spacecraft, due to the redundancy of measurements. Adding realism to the spacecraft clock model and the orbital propagator accuracy results in the single-vehicle position and velocity potentially better to what is achievable with high quality GNSS-based systems.},

Several researches have been launched to address this issue, presenting various original authentication mechanisms. The CNES experts started to deeply study this subject since 2008 and launched several studies in collaboration with private companies. With the objective to demonstrate the implementation of an effective authentication mechanism for Galileo and EGNOS, this paper aims at establishing a classification of all the possible authentication mechanisms. To do so, an inventory of authentication solutions is done, followed by the definition of a set of criteria to sort out these solutions. At the end, three classifications, based on three scenarios, are made and discussed.},

  abstract = {Clock ensembling is a well-established concept for creating robust and stable time frames, e.g. it is used to define the Universal Time Coordinated as well as the GPS system time. In order to reference Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) to a terrestrial time scale, the provision of a robust, reliable and stable system time is a mandatory key aspect. Here, we propose a mixed clock ensemble for system time generation in future GNSSs that exploit inter-satellite optical links to synchronize all elements of the constellation. We consider a Kalman filter-based algorithm which combines several different clock types. The algorithm computes predictions based on advanced clock models and updates the predicted state vector by processing differential measurements between the clocks in the ensemble. The state vector, which includes all parameters describing the clock behavior (i.e. phase, frequency and potentially Gauss-Markov states) is then used to produce a weighted average, named Implicit Ensemble Mean (IEM). The so-formed Composite Clock (CC) typically performs at the level of the best frequency reference of the ensemble for all time intervals in terms of stability. However, the so computed IEM is only a software solution with no physical/electrical output signal. In some cases a real signal output of this IEM is desirable or even mandatory, i.e. if it is used for synchronization of signals broadcasted by navigation satellites. The proposed mixed clock ensemble consists of both optical frequency references and classical microwave clocks. With this ensemble it is possible to realize a CC with fractional frequency stability below 10-15 [s/s] for time intervals between 100 and 105 s, serving as system time as well as an essential component of the synchronization scheme.},

  abstract = {Indoor positioning systems (IPS) are emerging technologies due to an increasing popularity and demand in location based service (LBS). Because traditional positioning systems such as GPS are limited to outdoor applications, many IPS have been proposed in literature. WLAN-based IPS are the most promising due to its proven accuracy and infrastructure deployment. Several WLAN-based IPS have been proposed in the past, from which the best results have been shown by so-called fingerprintbased systems. This paper proposes an indoor positioning system which extends traditional WLAN fingerprinting by using received signal strength (RSS) measurements along with channel estimates as an effort to improve classification accuracy for scenarios with a low number of Access Points (APs). The channel estimates aim to characterize complex indoor environments making it a unique “signature” for fingerprinting-based IPS and therefore improving pattern recognition in radio-maps. Since commercial WLAN cards offer limited measurement information, software-defined radio (SDR) as an emerging trend for fast prototyping and research integration is chosen as the best cost-effective option to extract channel estimates. Therefore, this paper first proposes an 802.11b WLAN SDR beacon receiver capable of measuring RSS and channel estimates. The SDR is designed using LabVIEW (LV) environment and leverages several inherent platform acceleration features that achieve realtime capturing. The receiver achieves a fast-rate measurement capture of 9 packets per second per AP. The classification of the propose IPS uses a support vector machine (SVM) for offline training and online navigation. Several tests are conducted in a cluttered indoor environment with a single AP in 802.11b legacy mode. Finally, navigation accuracy results are discussed.},

  abstract = {Recently, location-based services (LBS) have steered attention to indoor positioning systems (IPS). WLAN-based IPSs relying on received signal strength (RSS) measurements such as fingerprinting are gaining popularity due to proven high accuracy of their results. Typically, sets of RSS measurements at selected locations from several WLAN access points (APs) are used to calibrate the system. Retrieval of such measurements from WLAN cards are commonly at one-Hz rate. Such measurement collection is needed for offline radio-map surveying stage which aligns fingerprints to locations, and for online navigation stage, when collected measurements are associated with the radio-map for user navigation. As WLAN network is not originally designed for positioning, an RSS measurement miss could have a high impact on the fingerprinting system. Additionally, measurement fluctuations require laborious signal processing, and surveying process can be very time consuming. This paper proposes a fast-rate measurement collection method that addresses previously mentioned problems by achieving a higher probability of RSS measurement collection during a given one-second window. This translates to more data for statistical processing and faster surveying. The fast-rate collection approach is analyzed against the conventional measurement rate in a proposed testing methodology that mimics real-life scenarios related to IPS surveying and online navigation.},

Because of its reliance on many applications nowadays, it’s crucial for GNSS receivers to have robustness to intentional or unintentional interference. Because most commercial GPS receivers are not flexible, software-defined radio emerged as a promising solution for fast prototyping and research on interference mitigation algorithms. This paper provides a proposed minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) interference mitigation technique which is enhanced for computational feasibility and implemented on a real-time capable GPS L1 SDR receiver. The GPS SDR receiver SW has been optimized for real-time operation on National Instruments’ LabVIEW (LV) platform in conjunction with C/C++ dynamic link libraries (DLL) for improved efficiency. Performance results of said algorithm with real signals and injected interference are discussed. The proposed SDR receiver gains in terms of BER curves for several interferers are demonstrated.},

In the last decades, optical clock technologies evolved, where laboratory setups of single ion and lattice clocks have demonstrated frequency stabilities at the 10-18 level for longer integration times of a few thousand seconds. Setups using Doppler-free spectroscopy of molecular iodine have much lower complexity and demonstrated frequency stabilities at the 10-15 level for integration times up to 10,000 s. They might be an option for future GNSS, in a first step backing-up or replacing the currently used microwave clocks. Future concepts of GNSS employ optical technologies including optical frequency references and optical inter-satellite links. Beside long-term stability, also short-term stability of the oscillators is becoming relevant. Lasers, frequency stabilized to an optical cavity deliver short-term stability up to several seconds and are most promising candidates for such an oscillator. We present current work on the development of iodine- and cavity- based optical frequency references with respect to applications in GNSS.},

Especially in the case where the user needs high accuracy in addition to high reliability, the tolerable amount of interference shrinks to a minimum. With the dawn Galileo’s High Accuracy Service, a freely available PPP service broadcast by the MEO constellation itself, we focus on the use case of autonomous driving in this study. We derived a method to display potential implications of interference on the E6B signal reception on German highways based on the characteristics of the interference signal \& transmitter, user receiver and distance between them. Considering this, the delta in C/N0 (signal-to-noise ratio) is computed and may be understood as a “worst case” impediment. The topography is neglected in this study. With the procedure established, we parametrize three different receiver categories representative for various market sectors as well as two types signals, which are reckoned among the most popular within the amateur radio community on the E6 band. The final product of the study comprises a heatmap for each scenario, identifying the impact of a certain transmitter location on the closest user receiver. We show that, for specific receiver-signal combinations, coexistence is possible regarding the (1dB-IPC) 1dB interference protection criterion [1] to a large extent, yet there are still areas affected by severe interference.},

Only GNSS in combination with other sensor systems can face these challenges ahead. To be able to develop such complex multi-sensor systems, it is crucial to first establish a continuous, robust and flexible procedure to test and verify algorithms and their implementation at any stage of their development. Originating from a pure software receiver, the Multi-Sensor Navigation Analysis Tool (MuSNAT) [1], developed at the Institute of Space Technology and Space Applications (ISTA) at the Universität der Bundeswehr München, has evolved into a versatile navigation platform using various advanced GNSS positioning techniques and sensors such as LiDAR and IMU. Using previously developed GNSS and INS simulation tools within the scope of this paper, we demonstrate how we at ISTA realized our closedloop testing procedure and successfully generated and married synthetic GNSS and IMU data in an RTK/INS loose-coupling scenario. We successfully show the overall quality of the simulation and sensor fusion using the coincidence of a-posteriori INS biases and the initially simulated ones, in a high precision scenario, as well as the ambiguity fixing ratio of the GNSS phase measurements.},

  abstract = {Small-satellites are emerging as low-cost tools for performing science and exploration in deep space. These new class of space systems exploit the latest advances and miniaturization of electronics, computer hardware, sensors, power systems and communication technologies to promise reduced launch-cost and development cadence. These small-satellites offer the best option yet to explore some of the 17,000 Near-Earth Asteroids (NEA) and nearly 740,000 Main-Belt asteroids found. The exploration of these asteroids can give us insight into the formation of the solar-system, planetary defense and future prospect for space mining. Recent examples of asteroid/small-body missions target asteroids that are 100s of meters in length. Most of these discovered asteroids are 10s of meters in length and hence having the technology to explore them will open a new frontier in solar system exploration. However, these very small asteroids lack an accurate ephemeris and with current limitations in NASA’s Deep Space Network (DSN) communication and tracking system, there is a 2-5 km uncertainty in distance between a spacecraft and a target. Some of these small-bodies are carbon-rich and have low-albedos that make them hard to find. However, it is these carbon-rich asteroids that are prime targets for solar-system origin studies and for asteroid mining. Overall, this presents a major navigations challenge. In this work, we develop a solution to the problem at hand. This encompasses integration of the right navigational instruments, detectors, attitude determination and control system, together with propulsion and software control system to autonomously search and ‘home-in’ on the target body. Our navigation approach utilizes an outward spiraling ‘diamond maneuver’. The spacecraft spirals outwards if the small-body is not found in the volume enclosed. Once a small-body is found, the spacecraft performs gradient descent using its imagers to close-in on the small-body. In worst-case scenarios, visual techniques to detect occlusion or thermal imagery will be used to identify the target. Once found, the spacecraft performs a helical flyby maneuver to map the asteroid. The results point towards a promising pathway for further development and testing of our navigation technology aboard a demonstrator CubeSat.},

The results are rather stunning; a full C/A code sky search can typically be done in less than one second with excellent sensitivity whereas a traditionally architected GPS receiver might take 1 to 5 minutes to accomplish the same task. Furthermore, these results are obtained with an approach optimized for simplicity rather than top speed.},

  abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite System—Reflectometry (GNSS-R) measurements have demonstrated ability in high precision altimetry applications due to their potential for centimeter-level ranging precision, small spatial footprint sizes, and frequent revisit times. However, centimeter-level ranging precision is only achievable when the reflected signal can be coherently tracked, and coherent reflections more commonly occur when the incident ray is at a low elevation angle. A challenging factor is the tropospheric delay, which is significantly larger at low elevation angles, and becomes a dominant source of error in GNSS-R carrier-phase based altimetry. In this paper, we present a tropospheric error budget at low grazing angles specifically for GNSS-R applications using the Global Pressure and Temperature-3 model. The error budget is created by comparing GPT3 to a truth reference over 328 days in 2019 at specific elevation angles of 45, 30, 20, 15, 10, 7, and 5 degrees. The tropospheric error budget was generated at the KUUJ station in Hudson Bay and the CPNM station in the Java Sea to account for performance differences between dry and humid climates, respectively. Overall, we find clear regional, seasonal, and elevation angle dependencies in the tropospheric error budget. At 45 degrees elevation, the monthly mean tropospheric error ranges from -6.8 cm to 5.4 cm at KUUJ, and -18.4 cm to 20 cm at CPNM. When the elevation decreases to 5 degrees, the tropospheric error range significantly increases to a range of -46.7 cm to 38.3 cm at KUUJ, and -143.3 cm to 146.3 cm at CPNM.},

  abstract = {Alternative navigation is an area of research that employs a variety of sensor technologies to provide a navigation solution in Global Navigation Satellite System degraded or denied environments. The Autonomy and Navigation Technology Center at the Air Force Institute of Technology has recently developed the Autonomous and Resilient Management of All-source Sensors (ARMAS) navigation framework, which utilizes a bank of Kalman filters to provide a navigation solution resilient to sensor failures. The Kalman filter bank size increases exponentially as the number of system sensors and detectable faults are scaled up linearly, which in turn creates a stressful computational power requirement in a real-world large-scale ARMAS application. In an effort to engineer an operational real-time ARMAS system, this study presents a novel approach that utilizes multiple ARMAS subsystems cooperating as a single navigation system to generate a navigation solution with less computational demand. The new software design model allows batches of faulty sensors to be excluded from the final navigation solution under a multiple simultaneous sensor fault situation without the computational stress of identifying every individual faulty sensor. By segregating system sensors into unique groups that are susceptible to a failing under the same circumstances (i.e. satellites operating in the same frequency under a jamming scenario), an ARMAS subsystem can detect the first sensor failure in a group triggering the navigation system to remove the entire sensor group from the navigation solution while continuing recovery efforts within the ARMAS subsystem. Simulations results show that maintaining 37 simultaneous Kalman filters provided equivalent performance to the 2,533,987 simultaneous filters that would be required under the original formulation of ARMAS.},

The method is based on raw phase observation at 1Hz rate of ionosphere-free combinations of airborne frequencies GPS L1/L5 and GALILEO E1/E5a. Carrier and code phase residuals are obtained for a static IGSMGEX reference station after applying all the corrections used in a typical PPP approach. Receiver clock and tropospheric wet component are estimated using a time differentiation of weighted carrier phase residuals. This specific characteristic has the dual advantage of removing phase ambiguities, which are supposed to be constant over a satellite pass, and offering high robustness against multipath. Scintillation events are identified, quantified, and the duration period determined by observing different scintillation indices, like the ROTI, the AATR, and S4 indexes. An extensive analysis has been performed using several IGS stations at different latitudes to ensure the representativeness of the results for different regions of the globe, within a timeframe of more than two years, starting in January 2017. A statistical analysis of the scintillation induced errors is provided and recommendations for the standardization bodies are given.},

  abstract = {Existence of random electron-density fluctuations cause scintillation of radio waves on trans-ionospheric links. Ionospheric irregularities that account for scintillation may vary significantly in spatial range and drift with the background plasma at speeds of 45 m/sec to more than 130 m/sec. These patchy irregularities may occur several times during night, e.g. in equatorial region, with the patches move through the ray paths of the GNSS satellite signals. These irregularities are often characterized as either `large scale' (which can be as large as several hundred km in East-West direction and many times that in the North-South direction) or `small scale' (which can be as small as 1m). In normal solar activity conditions, the mid-latitude ionosphere is not much disturbed. However, during severe magnetic storms, the aurora oval extends towards the equator and the equator anomaly region may be stretched towards poles extending the scintillation phenomena into mid-latitudes. In such stormy conditions, the predicted total electron content (TEC) may deviate largely from the true value of the TEC both at low and mid-latitudes due to which GNSS applications may be strongly degraded. This work is an attempt to analyze ionospheric scintillation using ionospheric asymmetry index. The asymmetry index is based on trans-ionospheric propagation between GPS and LEO in radio occultation (RO) scenario, using background ionospheric data provided by MIDAS. Using MIDAS, we attempt to simulate one of the recent geomagnetic storms (NOAA scale G4) occurred over low/mid-latitudes. The storm started on 26 September 2011 at UT 18:00 and lasted until early hours of 27 September 2011. It was observed that the level of asymmetry was significantly increased during the main phase of the geomagnetic storm. This happened due to a significant change in ionization, which in turn produced large gradients along occulted ray path in the ionosphere. A very good correlation was found between the evaluated ionospheric asymmetry index and the S4 scintillation index.},

  abstract = {Below the altitude of peak density height (hmF2), it is rather easy to obtain the bottomside of the vertical electron density (Ne(h)) profile using measurements from ground based ionosonde and other sounding instruments. However, accurate modeling of the topside of the Ne(h) profile has always been a challenge. Since the introduction of radio occultation (RO) technique for the ionospheric monitoring, our understanding of the topside ionosphere has significantly improved. This study shows that by assimilating ionosonde foF2 and collocated RO Ne(h) profile data, a full-scale Ne(h) profile at any ionosonde location can be accurately modeled using NeQuick2 electron density model with multiple effective ionization level (Az) parameters. To implement the technique, NeQuick2 was modified with multiple effective parameters with each one of them having a task to model a specific part of the Ne(h) profile separately and exclusively. As a result, the shape of the resulting Ne(h) profile is matched closely with the corresponding experimental RO Ne(h) profile. To assess the accuracy of the technique, a comparison of vertical total electron content (VTEC) was calculated from experimental (RO retrieved), and NeQuick2 model assimilated Ne(h) profiles is presented. A very strong correlation has been found between the modeled and experimental Ne(h) profiles based on VTEC values. The experimental and modeled profile TEC values are found to be 99.5\% correlated. The proposed assimilation technique is self-sustaining, robust, and is not affected by the solar activity, season, and geographical location of the ionosonde.},

These standards are now in development by RTCA and the European Organization for Civil Aviation Equipment (EUROCAE). The previous interference assessment was published in 2004 within RTCA document DO-292. One of the primary interference concerns for L5/E5a signal processing is from Distance Measuring Equipment (DME)/Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) ground-based beacons. The assessment showed that at certain geographic locations an aviation user could observe multiple DMEs and experience aggregate pulsed interference with duty cycles in excess of 50\%. This led to suggestions for aviation receiver implementation details such as more stringent radiofrequency (RF) filtering and pulse blanking. The purpose of this paper is to update this portion of the assessment with additional DME/TACAN modeling and actual flight and ground RF data collections.},

Pulsed interference recently has been revisited due to the expectation of planned satellite systems using some portion of the L2 frequency band for radar operations. The current WAAS ground system uses both L1 and L2 GPS signals to conduct signal processing for correction and integrity bounds generation. Until the GPS constellation provides an L5 capability the L2 signal is mandatory for this processing so naturally any new sources of interference must be examined to ensure system performance is not degraded. This paper will investigate the current pulsed RF operating environment at the WAAS reference stations, evaluate receiver performance in the presence of pulsed interference in laboratory testing, and characterize existing margin that could potentially be used in compatibility assessments for these emerging satellite radar systems.},

  abstract = {A method to obtain sub-meter level navigation accuracy with cellular long-term evolution (LTE) signals is developed. The proposed method utilizes an LTE software-defined receiver (SDR) mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which can produce carrier and code phase and Doppler frequency measurements from received LTE signals. Single difference measurements are used to remove the effect of the receiver’s clock bias. LTE eNodeBs’ clock biases are initialized using the known initial position of the UAV. The measurements are fused via an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to estimate the UAV’s position and integer ambiguities of the carrier phase single difference measurements. It is shown that since LTE signals have different carrier frequencies, conventional algorithms cannot be used to estimate the integer ambiguities. An algorithm to detect cycle slip is proposed, where the carrier phase measurements from the LTE eNodeB’s multiple antenna ports are used to detect cycle slip. Experimental results show a two-dimensional (2-D) position root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 81 cm between the LTE navigation solution and the one obtained by a global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) receiver with real-time kinematic (RTK) coupled with an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Finally, the sources of error that affect the navigation solution accuracy are discussed.},

  abstract = {The emergence of Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) has set a marked paradigm in the photogrammetric and mapping community that has not only facilitated comprehensive 3D mapping of different environments but has also paved way for new aspects of applied research in this direction. Out of the many essential blocks that make these MMS a viable tool for mapping, the positioning and orientation module is considered to be a crucial yet an expensive component. The integration of such a module with mapping sensors has allowed for the extensive implementation of such systems to provide high-quality maps. However, while such systems do not lack in system robustness and performance in general, the deployment of these systems is restricted to applications and environments where a consistent availability of GNSS signals is assured. Extending these MMS to GNSS-denied areas, such as indoor environments, is therefore quite challenging and necessitates the development of an alternative module that can act as a viable substitute to GNSS/INS for system operation without having to resort to an exhaustive modification of the same to function in GNSS-denied locations. In this research, such a case has been considered for the implementation of an indoor MMS using an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) and a 3D laser scanner for the task of generating high density maps of GNSS-denied indoor areas. To mitigate the absence of GNSS data, this paper proposes a Pseudo-GNSS/INS module integrated framework which utilizes probabilistic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques to estimate the platform pose and heading from 3D laser scanner data. This proposed framework has been implemented based on three major notions: (i) using geometric methods for sparse point cloud extraction to carry out real-time SLAM, (ii) generating position data and geo-referencing signals from these real-time SLAM pose estimates, and (iii) carrying out the entire operation through use of a single 3D mapping sensor. The final geo-referenced point cloud can then be generated through post-processing by the Iterative Closest Projected Point (ICPP) registration technique which also diminishes the effect of sensor measurement noise. The implementation, performance and results of the proposed MMS framework for an indoor mapping system have been presented in this paper that demonstrate the ability of this Pseudo-GNSS/INS framework to operate flexibly in GNSS-denied areas.},

  abstract = {GNSS receivers need to be able to exclude faulty navigation signals to ensure accurate PNT determination. These faults can be the result of satellite errors, multipath interference, or deliberate spoofing of multiple signals. A new method for determining consistent sets of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals in the presence of faults is presented. A consistent set is defined as having residuals with small magnitudes for each measurement, where a residual is the difference between an actual measurement and a predicted measurement obtained by applying the set’s position-velocity-time (PVT) solution to the pseudorange and pseudorange rate equations for a single signal. Bayesian inference is used to score sets using the posterior log-probability ratio (LPR), which is a metric that is monotonic with the posterior probability that the set is true, where truth here means that each signal in the set comes from a direct line-of-sight (LOS) reception from an actual GNSS satellite rather than a spoofed signal, multipath or a fault.},

  abstract = {Since the advancement in Smartphone GNSS positioning and the availability of GNSS observation via Android API, much of the focus have been given to bring down the Smartphone GNSS positioning accuracy from decimeter level to the centimeter level. But, considering many limitations such as Smartphone GNSS antenna, multipath and cycle slips, bringing down the accuracy to centimeter level is not an easy task. Many research work in this domain has demonstrated that the use of embedded sensors (IMU) inside the Smartphone can definitely ease the burden on GNSS. Researchers have already successfully processed the GNSS/IMU data collected from the Smartphone and highlighted some interesting results. But, when dealing with the GNSS/IMU processing, time-synchronization between GNSS and IMU data plays a vital role. Specially, in devices like Smartphone, when the GNSS and IMU data are not driven by the common clock, it becomes more important to study and analyze the effect of time-synchronizing between these two data sets. This paper gives reader an in-depth explanation about the need of time-synchronizing and the complete implementation overview. This paper will start with section I, giving an introduction to the current state of Smartphone GNSS positioning and discussing some limitations. In section II, we give an overview about our in-house GNSS/IMU logger developed at the institute. The complete time-synchronizing methodology has been implemented inside this Android Logger. In Section III, we will discuss the core of our research regarding implementation of time-synchronizing technique and their relevant equations.

  abstract = {This thesis presents a new approach for the guidance and control of a UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicle). A special focus was placed on moving obstacles that interfere with the planned path of the vehicle, this is due to the fact that the majority of obstacle avoidance research has been completed on stationary objects. An obstacle avoidance algorithm was developed using an integrated system involving Proportional Navigation (Pro-Nav) and a Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC). An obstacle avoidance variant of the ideal proportional navigation law generates command lateral accelerations to avoid obstacles, while the NMPC is used to track the reference trajectory given by the Pro-Nav. The NMPC utilizes a lateral vehicle dynamic model along with a nonlinear tire model in order to issue control inputs. In this application an obstacle avoidance algorithm can take over the control of a vehicle until the obstacle is no longer a threat. Another application of a Pro-Nav and NMPC algorithm was tested for leader/follower situations. The performance of the leader/follower and obstacle avoidance algorithm is evaluated through different simulations. Simulation of the performance of the PNCAG and NMPC algorithm was conducted using two different simulation environments; MATLAB and Simulink Vehicle Dynamics Blockset. The MATLAB simulation validated the algorithm showing that it could be used to accomplish obstacle avoidance. With the algorithm shown to be effective, it was placed into the Vehicle Dynamics Blockset. The Vehicle Dynamics Blockset provided a higher fidelity vehicle model to provide a more realistic simulation environment. In addition to obstacle avoidance, simulation results verified the performance of a modified version of the PNCAG and NMPC algorithm in a leader/follower scenario. The results show, the algorithm handled the leader/follower and collision avoidance with reasonable error. Overall the algorithm was also able to follow a lead vehicle throughout a double lane change as well as avoid collision with a moving obstacle in four different scenarios.},

These techniques are combined in the least squares collocation software COMEDIE (Collocation of Meteorological Data for Interpretation and Estimation of Tropospheric Path Delays), further upgraded to integrate GNSS and InSAR observations. We combine GNSS zenith total delays with InSAR atmospheric screens estimated using Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) and we investigate some important aspects of this combination, such as InSAR image size and pixel resolution and slant delay mapping function assumption. InSAR/GNSS integration in a collocation approach (COMEDIE) is a new aspect of this work. From the combination of data acquired in the Alpine region of Switzerland, we achieved: 1) in case of simulated measurements, a few mm accuracy (in terms of mean and standard deviation) and 2) in case of real measurements, combination products more congruent with InSAR results (due to the high density of InSAR measurements).},

  abstract = {Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) has been one of the most popular yet affordable navigation systems for indoor and even outdoor applications. VIO can augment or replace Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) under signal degradation or service interruptions. Conventionally, the fusion of visual and inertial modalities has been performed using optimization-based or filtering-based techniques such as nonlinear Least Squares (LS) or Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). These classic techniques, despite several simplifying approximations, involve sophisticated modelling and parameterization of the navigation problem, which necessitates expert fine-tuning of the navigation system. In this work, a calibration-free visual-inertial fusion technique using Deep Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (DCRNN) is proposed. The network employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to process the spatial information embedded in visual data and two Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to process the inertial sensor measurements and the CNN output for final pose estimation. The network is trained with raw Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data and monocular camera frames as its inputs, and the relative pose as its output. Unlike the conventional VIO techniques, there is no need for IMU biases and scale factors, intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera to be explicitly provided or modelled in the proposed navigation system, rather these parameters along with system dynamics are implicitly learned during the training phase. Moreover, since the inertial and visual data are fused at mid-layers in the network, deeper correlations of these two modalities are learned compared to a simple combination of the final pose estimates of both modalities at the output layers, hence, the fusion can be considered as a tightly-coupled fusion of visual and inertial modalities. The proposed VIO network is evaluated on real datasets and thorough discussion is provided on the capabilities of the deep learning approach toward VIO.},

  abstract = {In this thesis, Global Positioning System (GPS) and radar measurements are utilized in a multi-sensor architecture to achieve a confident relative positioning solution between two vehicles. A GPS solution providing a three-dimensional positioning vector is determined using pseudorange and carrier phase measurements. The carrier phase measurements make sub-meter level accuracy achievable. However, the carrier phase ambiguity must be resolved before estimating the relative position vector. A Dynamic Base Real-Time Kinematic (DRTK) positioning algorithm using differential GPS methods is used to achieve highly precise relative positioning between the two GPS antennas. A comparison of the performance of the DRTK algorithm using either single frequency (L1 or L2 frequency only) or dual frequency (L1 and L2 frequency) measurements is introduced. The radar measurements including range, range rate, and bearing are utilized in a probabilistic data association filter (PDAF). The PDAF determines which of the radar channels’ solutions are considered valid, and the weighted mean of these solutions is used as the selected target measurements. The PDAF algorithm is discussed in great detail, and the performance of the PDAF algorithm using radar measurements and the performance of the DRTK solution are compared and presented demonstrating that the radar PDAF solution tracks the desired target with reasonable accuracy as long as the lead vehicle is in line of sight. Finally, the DRTK algorithm is extended to incorporate the radar PDAF solution to increase solution availability, output rate, and reliability of the algorithm’s solution. The PDAF algorithm’s solution using the radar measurements can be utilized during GPS outages. The update rate of the radar measurements is ten times faster than the rate of the GPS receiver. The resultant combined system produces estimates at a much higher output rate. The integrated DRTK/PDAF system is implemented with three integration architectures including two “switch” methods and a sensor fusion Kalman filter. Analysis of the accuracy of the integrated systems is presented using experimental data collected on various test vehicles, and some conclusions can be made. The GPS measurements can assist the PDAF solution when the lead vehicle is not visible to the following vehicle. Also, the DRTK/PDAF integrated system produces a more robust relative positioning solution at a higher update rate than either sensor could produce individually.},

  abstract = {Communication connectivity is desirable for safe and efficient operation of multi-robot systems. While decentralized algorithms for connectivity maintenance have been explored in recent literature, the majority of these works do not account for robot motion and sensing uncertainties. These uncertainties are inherent in practical robots and result in robots deviating from their desired positions which could potentially result in a loss of connectivity. In this paper we present a Decentralized Connectivity Maintenance algorithm accounting for robot motion and sensing Uncertainties (DCMU). We first propose a novel weighted graph definition for the multi-robot system that accounts for the aforementioned uncertainties along with realistic connectivity constraints such as line-of-sight connectivity and collision avoidance. Next we design a decentralized gradient-based controller for connectivity maintenance where we derive the gradients of our weighted graph edge weights required for computing the control. Finally, we perform multiple simulations to validate the connectivity maintenance performance of our DCMU algorithm under robot motion and sensing uncertainties and show an improvement compared to previous work.},

  abstract = {An important component of path planning algorithms is predicting state uncertainty in order to ensure probabilistic collision-free paths. While predicting state uncertainty, path planning algorithms generally assume zero mean Gaussian distributions for motion and measurement error models. However, a zero mean Gaussian assumption is not applicable for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning measurements, which typically contain uncertain biases in urban areas due to multipath and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) effects. In this paper, we propose a method to predict the state uncertainty of a UAV in the presence of uncertain GNSS positioning biases using stochastic reachability analysis. We enclose all possible GNSS positioning error distributions arising due to uncertain biases with a probabilistic zonotope. For the on-board state estimation filter, we choose a Kalman filter (KF) and fix a hypothesis for the GNSS positioning error distribution. We first compute the stochastic set of estimation errors resulting from the above hypothesis. We then compute the stochastic reachable sets for a linear motion model of the UAV with linear state feedback control along the candidate path. Finally, we validate the stochastic reachability analysis by evaluating the predicted state uncertainty along candidate paths in a simulated 3D urban environment.},

  abstract = {Trajectory planning in the presence of motion and sensing uncertainties is an active field of research for autonomous systems. Previous works predict state and state estimation uncertainties along candidate trajectories in order to check for collision safety. However, these works assume either a stochastic or a bounded sensing uncertainty model, which may not always be valid. For instance GNSS pseudorange measurements are typically modeled to contain stochastic uncertainties along with an additional bias due to signal reflections in urban environments. Thus, given bounds for the additional bias, the trajectory planner needs to account for the presence of both stochastic and bounded sensing uncertainties. In our prior work [1] we presented a reachability analysis to predict state and state estimation uncertainties in the presence of both stochastic and bounded sensing uncertainties. However, we ignored the correlation between the state and the state estimation uncertainties, which led to an imperfect approximation of the state uncertainty. Thus, in this paper we first improve our prior reachability analysis by predicting state uncertainty as a function of independent (and hence uncorrelated) quantities. Next, we design a metric for the predicted state uncertainty in order to compare candidate trajectories within a planning framework. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the trajectory planner for GNSSbased navigation of fixed-wing unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in urban environments. We statistically validate the collision safety of the planned trajectories for a single UAS in a static environment and for multiple UAS in a shared airspace.},

However, the correlation between S4c, ROTI, and S4 remains unclear, particularly for ionospheric scintillation on positioning accuracy. First of all, we analyze an ionospheric scintillation event caused by the eruption of Tonga volcano on January 15, 2022. The experimental data is collected through Septentrio PolaRx5S at Fudan University. Secondly, we analyze the ionospheric scintillation in Sanya, Hainan on October 26, 2021. The experimental data is based on observation with 1Hz sampling rate from the BeiDou Ground Reference Stations by Qianxun Spatial Intelligence. According to the statistical results, the correlation coefficient between ROTI,S4c and S4 based on Ionospheric Scintillation Monitoring Receivers(ISMRs) are all about 0.65. Finally, we used the PPP algorithm with strong constraint of VTEC modelling to obtain position coordinates for Sanya station and preliminarily analyzed the influence of ionospheric scintillation on positioning.},

Several effective methods have been proposed in the past five years based on different observation combinations and positioning models. But no much reported work on integer ambiguity searching and validation in PPP. As to the integer ambiguity searching, it is often difficult to conduct the full ambiguity resolution particularly with a high level of reliability. For example, when a new satellite rises above the elevation angle mask, the observations to this satellite will be much noisier than other satellites and will affect the precisions of other ambiguities. This will slow down the speed of the integer ambiguity searching, or even lead to the wrongly fixed integer values. On the other hand, the challenge of the ambiguity validation lies in the determination of the thresholds for the reliability tests such as the success rate test and the ratio test.},

The approach dealt in this paper is to train the system with neural network utilizing accurate post processed carrier phase differential GNSS position. The flight data for the research is obtained through 2.5-hour flight, including IMU measurements, raw GNSS range and ephemeris information, etc. In order to train the networks, a custom reinforcement learning environment was designed. The environment defined the interaction between agent and its surrounding, with state, action, and reward. Applied policy and value optimizing A2C algorithm for continuous action space is described. With proposed continuous action A2C, the network achieved higher score compared to the baseline.

In existing MEMS based PDR system, because MEMS is mounted on shoes or helmet, the sensor axes are fixed regardless of user motion. But in case of using smartphone, the axes of sensor are changed according to the user walking motion. To overcome this condition, we detect the walking motion using pattern recognition algorithm with sensor measurements from smarthphone and apply different PDR algorithms according to the walking motion. The height information of pedestrian is also estimated using the barometric pressure sensor in the smartphone. The 3D position which is consisted of 2D PDR position and height information is provided to the pedestrian. Our system has several advantages in cost and availability. No peripheral devices are needed for localization except smartphone because it contains the sensors used for the localization such as accelerometer, magnetometer, barometer and gyroscope and Wi-Fi card. We developed the android based application and experimental results show the accurate positioning and tracking performance.},

  abstract = {Potential Field is one of the widely used path planning methods in robotics. This method assumes that a robotic system knows its current position and where the goal is. The location of obstacles is also known in advance for global path planning, or it can be detected from sensing in local path planning. Although the potential field method provides a convenient and simple way of generating paths, most previous approaches do not incorporate uncertainty of a platform position while it is moving. Unlike satellite-based navigation systems, a user positioning accuracy may significantly change in a local area if a positioning system basis on Ultra Wideband (UWB) or LTE/5G is used. Because the positioning accuracy varies while a vehicle navigates, an unmanned vehicle or a robot following a given path may experience dithering movement. In addition, this problem may lead to unnecessary oscillation and increase the probability of collision which is a critical treat for a safe navigation. To overcome the drawbacks, this paper proposes the PF-DOP hybrid path planning algorithms, which is a variant of potential field that takes into account a user positioning accuracy. A user positioning accuracy (UPA) in an interested navigation area can be conveniently represented by Dilution of Precision (DOP) field. From the mixture of the potential and DOP fields, the proposed approach generates a hybrid directional flow that is able to guide an unmanned vehicle to the safer and more efficient paths. The hybrid directional flow is made by mixing the two fields with weighting factors which is also used in traditional potential field method as a coefficient. The weighting factors will vary depending on the user locations, but as the positioning accuracy can be derived from the user location, the user positioning accuracy is also associated. The paper will describe the systemic procedure in generating the PF-DOP hybrid path and how to avoid local minimum by using this algorithm.},

  abstract = {High-accuracy absolute localization for a team of vehicles is essential when accomplishing various kinds of tasks. As a promising approach, collaborative localization fuses the individual motion measurements and the inter-vehicle measurements to collaboratively estimate the states. In this paper, we focus on the range-only collaborative localization, which specifies the inter-vehicle measurements as inter-vehicle ranging measurements. We first investigate the observability properties of the system and derive that to achieve bounded localization errors, two vehicles are required to remain static like external infrastructures. Under the guide of the observability analysis, we then propose our range-only collaborative localization system which categorize the ground vehicles into two static vehicles and dynamic vehicles. The vehicles are connected utilizing a UWB network that is capable of both producing inter-vehicle ranging measurements and communication. Simulation results validate the observability analysis and demonstrate that collaborative localization is capable of achieving higher accuracy when utilizing the inter-vehicle measurements. Extensive experimental results are performed for a team of 3 and 5 vehicles. The real-world results illustrate that our proposed system enables accurate and real-time estimation of all vehicles’ absolute poses.},

In this paper, we present a novel accurate, robust and low-cost GNSS-independent navigation system, which is composed of a monocular camera and Ultra-wideband (UWB) transceivers. Visual techniques have gained excellent results when computing the incremental motion of the sensor, and UWB methods have proved to provide promising localization accuracy due to the high time resolution of the UWB ranging signals. However, the monocular visual techniques with scale ambiguity are not suitable for applications requiring metric results, and UWB methods assume that the positions of the UWB transceiver anchor are pre-calibrated and known, thus precluding their application in unknown and challenging environments. To this end, we advocate leveraging the monocular camera and UWB to create a map of visual features and UWB anchors. We propose a visual-UWB Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm which tightly combines visual and UWB measurements to form a joint non-linear optimization problem on Lie-Manifold. The 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) state of the vehicles and the map are estimated by minimizing the UWB ranging errors and landmark reprojection errors. Our navigation system starts with an exploratory task which performs the real-time visual-UWB SLAM to obtain the global map, then the navigation task by reusing this global map. The tasks can be performed by different vehicles in terms of equipped sensors and payload capability in a heterogeneous team. We validate our system on the public datasets, achieving typical centimeter accuracy and 0.1\% scale error.},

  abstract = {Achieving more accurate autonomous positioning of mobile robots in indoor environments is the basis for realizing robot indoor navigation applications. In order to achieve accurate autonomous localization of mobile robot in indoor scene, we need to choose several localization algorithms suitable for indoor environmental conditions from the existing algorithms for autonomous localization of robots. At this stage, scholars have proposed many algorithms to realize robot autonomous position, but these algorithms often not only have problems such as high computational complexity, system accuracy and stability affected by the wrong depth matching, but also some technologies that cannot be used indoors, such as satellites positioning, even some technologies have very strict requirements for the scene, such as geomagnetic positioning. If the robot is in an indoor environment that is severely affected by magnetic forces, the geomagnetic positioning will fail and accurate positioning will not be possible. Therefore, in order to achieve a more robust and efficient autonomous localization algorithm for indoor mobile robot. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to realize the autonomous localization of indoor mobile robot in known scenes by fusing monocular camera and LiDAR (Light-Laser Detection and Ranging) technology. The algorithm makes full use of the information provided by depth learning model and laser point cloud. Firstly, the monocular camera is used to make the training data set: the 3D point cloud map of the known scene is projected into the grid map, define the appropriate coordinate axis for the grid map, determine the precise coordinates of each grid, and use a monocular camera to take a certain number of pictures for the scene, and assign a certain grid to each picture, so that each picture has specific coordinates corresponding to it. After the training set is established, a deep learning algorithm is used to train a model that can use two-dimensional RGB images to determine the coordinates of the camera's location. This is where the mobile robot is. Finally, combined with the LiDAR information of the indoor mobile robot, the estimated coordinates are modified more carefully to get more accurate positioning. The algorithm of indoor mobile robot localization based on the fusion of vision sensor and LiDAR proposed in this paper is an improvement over the existing single sensor localization algorithm, which combines the existing deep learning model with the information provided by LiDAR. It effectively improves the positioning accuracy of the indoor mobile robot, improves the working efficiency of the mobile robot, and provides a better and higher guarantee for the navigation and other operations of the mobile robot in indoor scene, and promotes the better development of robot industry.},

  abstract = {Indian NavIC signals are received by various users equipped with the NavIC receivers in both L5 (1176.45 MHz) and S band (2492.028 MHz) frequencies. A NavIC receivers basically measures pseudo-ranges, carrier-ranges and Doppler observables for PVT. Pseudo-range measurements are absolute in nature, robust and therefore more widely used for the positioning purposes. However, pseudo-range measurements are more vulnerable to multipath. This deteriorates the measurement precision as well as robustness of the system to perform positioning in the challenging environments such as foliage, tall building or in the presence of the reflectors in the vicinity of the receiver. However, if receiver has the knowledge of Line of Sight (LOS), Multipath and Non Line of Sight (NLOS) signals, degradation in position accuracy due to the multipath affected signals can be addressed. In this regard, machine learning algorithms can be very effective in detection and classification of these signals. However, supervised machine learning algorithms require labelled data from the independent sources such as ray tracing, building models, 3D mapping aided with positioning etc.. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose to use unsupervised learning algorithms and classify the signals purely based on the unlabeled data. Results are presented using NavIC data collected at Dehradun, India. This study may be useful for detection and removal of multipath affected signals for more robust positioning applications.},

Conventional GNSS receivers provide under such conditions only a degraded accuracy. At the same time, applying an effective but computationally complex multipath mitigation algorithm potentially exceeds cost or energy consumption requirements. Therefore, a low-complexity multipath mitigation technique is proposed in this paper. It relies on a multi-correlator structure with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) replacing the conventional delay locked loop (DLL) for the code tracking. Multipath resilience is achieved by incorporating the radio propagation channel between satellite and user in the measurement model, inherently accounting for reflected signal replicas. In order to reduce complexity, the effect of the number and distribution of the correlators used has been investigated. It turned out, that even with a very low number of correlators, a high multipath mitigation capability is maintained. The results have been validated with actual measurement data.},

In this paper we show how the BCRLB can be calculated by fitting a Gaussian process (GP) to magnetometer measurements to obtain an analytical expression of the magnetic field along a railway line. The proposed GP-based BCRLB is evaluated with the magnetic field of a 1 km long track segment. Furthermore, a comparison between the bound and the estimation error of a particle filter shows the sub-optimality of the particle filter for magnetic railway localization.},

Localization must be available independent from the environment and must provide a high accuracy and reliability. A single localization solution most likely will not be able to fulfill this requirement. GNSS for example will not be available in tunnels. In this paper, we therefore investigate an alternative localization method based on position-dependent distortions of the Earth magnetic field. The advantage of this approach is that it is also available in GNSS-denied areas. If GNSS is available, it can be seen as a low-cost method to obtain redundant position information. The work presented here is an evaluation of the algorithm proposed in our prior work [1], in which we showed how an uncalibrated magnetometer can be used to simultaneously estimate the position of a model train and the magnetometer calibration parameters. The evaluation presented in this paper applies the simultaneous localization and calibration algorithm to data measured with two different trains driving on a rural track network in Germany. The evaluation shows that magnetic field based localization using only an uncalibrated magnetometer is also possible in real railway environments.},

  abstract = {In this paper a new method for relative train localization in global navigation satellite system (GNSS) denied areas is proposed. The proposed localization system is long-term stable and based solely on magnetometer and odometer measurements. The system utilizes that the magnetic field shows strong and time persistent variations along a railway track. Two trains driving on the same track will observe the same magnetic field variations but with a certain shift. This shift depends on the relative position of the trains and their speed. By measuring the train speed with an odometer it becomes possible to estimate the relative position by comparing the magnetometer and odometer measurements of two trains. In this paper we use cross-correlation to obtain the relative position estimate from a batch of measurements. A subsequent Kalman filter is used to smooth the estimate and to incorporate prior knowledge of the train dynamics. We further derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the relative position estimate to investigate the theoretically achievable localization accuracy and to approximate the variance of the relative position estimate in the update step of the Kalman filter. In an evaluation the feasibility and accuracy of the approach is shown based on measurement data collected with a train driving in a rural area. The results indicate that with the proposed method the relative position can be estimated with sub-meter accuracy.},

  abstract = {For the automation of railway systems, a crucial requirement is a reliable localization system that is able to localize all trains in the track network. While in most parts of the track network, GNSS signals are available and provide a satisfying navigation solution, there are also parts where shadowing and multipath renders GNSS signals unavailable. In such scenarios, magnetic field-based localization can complement GNSS. Magnetic field localization is based on the observation that ferromagnetic material in the vicinity of a railway track introduces distortions in the Earth magnetic field. These distortions are persistent over time and therefore can be used for localization when stored in a map. In our a prior work we showed that particle filters can be used to perform magnetic localization. In this paper, we extend the particle filter with fault detection and exclusion capabilities to make it more robust and accurate in the presence of sensor faults and measurement errors. The advantage of the proposed particle filter w.r.t. accuracy and robustness is shown in an evaluation with measurement data.},

  abstract = {Due to the widespread use of anti-jam electronics (AJ-E) with controllable radiation pattern antennas (CRPA) in estimating direction of arrival (DOA), considerations of Doppler and contributions through antenna phase manifold should be considered for both error characterization in AJ-E covariance output and effectiveness of nulling algorithms. By considering the manifold effects, an observability space can be estimated a priori and provided to down-stream DOA filters. The observability space also provides an expected error characterization for AJ-E’s signal covariance matrix used to derive weights for their individual antenna element feeds and taps. This estimated covariance matrix is typically derived from a windowed set of In-phase and Quadrature phase (IQ) samples collected over a set length of time (typically 1 ms). Most per-element delays are constant over this time period, but some vehicles hosting the AJ-E have roll rates which, when mapped through the antenna phase manifold, can create Doppler coloring of the covariance estimate. Even with benign roll rates, the manifold coloring of the Doppler can be significant. This paper examines the Doppler influence through a commercial CRPA's phase manifold and maps the per-component phase error perceived. The paper demonstrates the effect through software simulated IQ data samples and a commercial phase manifold.},

  abstract = {Vertical navigation is essential for new aviation operations like precision approaches and automatic landing which are expected to be primarily based on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). However, achieving tighter vertical requirements with GNSS is challenging due to the inherent geometrical limitations. Current Aircraft-Based Augmentation Systems (ABAS) developments focus on proving that Advanced Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (ARAIM) is able to provide a robust operation for horizontal services and vertical guidance via the use of Multi-frequency and Multi-constellation GNSS. Although ARAIM can achieve high levels of integrity, the availability and continuity of the system may be compromised by the loss of satellites or high presence of cycle slips. For this reason, the support of onboard sensors like barometers is essential to guarantee all the vertical navigation requirements and extend the achievable accuracy and integrity for future even more stringent operations. This paper aims at augmenting GNSS navigation with geodetic altitude obtained from aircraft barometric pressure measurements and external weather data within a robust navigation architecture based on ARAIM. The present work describes the derivations of the threat and error models that are required for the inclusion of this barometric geodetic altitude into ARAIM. The improvement in availability is simulated world-wide with respect to the expected uncertainty of the geodetic barometric altitude. Then, real flight data is used to show the benefit of the barometer augmentation on the integrity of the navigation solution under real operational scenarios. The error models are obtained from several hours of flight data collected during a flight tests campaign performed in 2018 with the German Aerospace Center’s (DLR) Dassault Falcon aircraft.},

  author = {Simsky, Andrew},
  abstract = {The vulnerability to interruption of signal tracking is a well-known problem of standard PPP technology based on float ambiguities. In conventional PPP algorithms, any outage of tracking would trigger a complete reset and reinitialization of ionosphere-free phase ambiguities. In other words, for float PPP there is no difference between a “cold start” and a “hot start”. This presents a serious problem for all land applications, where a vehicle or a surveyor would occasionally pass under an obstacle. This paper presents the performance assessment of an effective gap bridging algorithm, which significantly enhances the usability of the PPP technology, especially for land applications. This algorithm is integrated into an industrial float PPP engine and has been tested in real-life applications. It has been proven to provide near-perfect bridging in benign open-sky conditions and to dramatically reduce both convergence time and positional deviations in more challenging environments.},

  abstract = {The Dilution of Precision (DOP) is used as a quality measure in satellite positioning since it shows the geometric effect that connects positioning and measurement errors. It is a scalar indicator on the quality of the least-squares solution given by the square root of the sum of the parameter estimate variances considering that the User Equivalent Range Error (UERE) is the same for all satellites. The DOP may represent the precision of the adjustment but on the other hand, it may not always reflect the GNSS position error faithfully as the user equivalent range error tends to be different for each satellite at any time instant. Therefore, DOP presents limitations to correlate with the position error since it takes into consideration only the satellite geometric formation and neglects signal transmission-related errors, which become dominant for low-elevation satellites. This study presented a new approach to use the DOP as a weighted element taking into consideration the elevation angle from the satellite for periods of high and low ionosphere activity in the equatorial region. For this, the BRAZ station was chosen from the Brazilian Continuous Monitoring Network (RBMC) as a study case. The reference coordinates used were acquired from the description file and are: x = 4114014.0848, y= -4550641.5491 and z = -1741444.0190. To evaluate the proposed method two years were chosen: 2014 and 2019. For each year, six days were analyzed, WPDOP showed a moderate positive correlation for 8 out of the 12 analyzed days, for the summer of 2014 it presented a negative correlation. Meanwhile, PDOP presented a weak/very weak correlation for 11 out of the 12 days analyzed. WPDOP presented a higher capacity of indicated the accuracy of the SPP.},

Location coordinates of the land vehicles are obtained with GNSS and maps for choosing the route and guidance for driving. Similarly, in near future driver-less cars are expected to enter into the market. For this purpose only GNSS is not sufficient for navigation, the best complementary system for GNSS is Inertial Navigation System (INS). In this paper, we proposed the loosely coupled integration of low cost Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) based Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) with NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation). As the NavIC is a regional navigational satellite system, it can be used only in India and surroundings. Low-cost MEMS based IMU BMI160 and a NavIC enabled receiver is used to evaluate the performance of the loosely coupled integrated navigation solution. The calibration of the IMU is done using Allan variance with stationary data. Generally, low cost IMU is calibrated or updated using GNSS measurements. However, in the absence of GNSS and the vehicle is stationary, IMU is calibrated and updated using Zero Velocity Update (ZVU) method.},

  abstract = {This study seeks to improve the localization estimate of swarm robotics through cooperation, agents sharing information, and coordination, multiple robots altering their movements to work together, by utilizing boids rules. Since swarm robots are often constructed of simple and low-quality sensors, due to the increase in cost with swarm size, complex perception tasks, such as localization, become difficult challenges to solve. However, robot swarms have the advantage of large numbers. Therefore, the robots can coordinate their movements, to perform more localization measurements with each other to improve their localization estimates. Boids rules model complex biological flocking behavior, that allows the swarm to coordinate their movements. Thus, by incorporating flocking behavior, into the localization strategy, the robots can group together and perform more localization updates at necessary. In addition, this study expands boids rules with the inclusion of homing and task rules, along with adapting the gains on each rule based on the local stimuli of neighboring robots and the current localization estimate. As a result, the robots are encouraged to perform more favorable emergent behaviors such as clustering when the agents’ localization estimates are poor and diffusion behaviors when the estimate is sufficient. The proposed algorithm is decentralized and independent of the localization strategy, thus it can be easily incorporated into existing swarm robotic frameworks. This method was tested with multiple localization frameworks such as decentralized EKF, Covariance Intersection, and Dead Reckoning in a randomly generated way-point bounded environment. As a result of this study, at the cost of increasing task completion time, the proposed algorithm was able to improve the average localization estimate of the swarm, with the greatest improvement occurring at low-density swarms with poor estimators.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the development and testing of spoofing detection and localization techniques that rely only on clock deviations to identify threat signals. Detection methods that rely on dynamic receiver geometries to triangulate threat locations or signal geometry to identify spoofing are not considered here. Instead this paper focuses on single antenna receivers and assumes the receiver tracks only the inauthentic signal. The quality of the receiver clock has a significant impact on the performance of the receiver tracking loops. Low quality clocks have frequency instabilities that inherently limit the sensitivity of the receiver to slow growing errors. Some clocks provide better frequency stabilities but have a higher white frequency noise that can induce false detections. Because of these trends, various detection methods are tested with four types of receiver and transmitter clocks of varying quality.},

  abstract = {Urban environments introduce a challenge for unaided GNSS to provide accurate coordinates at all times, which makes this approach insufficient for many applications. Recent developments in intelligent transportation systems lead to an evolution of such techniques as map matching, 3D map aiding, shadow matching, and visual-aided navigation. These methods along with inertial-sensor integration proved to improve the capability of low-cost-equipment-based precise positioning applications. The plethora of available sensors allows devices to collect rich contextual data and permits the user to adapt the positioning engine parameters to different environments. The limitation of past research using a single positioning platform is that context detection is solved independently, based on self-monitoring. Individual device sensor readings are prone to being affected by random errors and to increase the reliability of context detection, multiple readings should be made, which is not feasible in many real-time applications. In an urban setting, it is reasonable to assume that many identical platforms will collect similar sensor readings when operating in a given area. The research described in this paper aims to explore the use of collectively recorded context information with further processing, integrating the data with a map and feeding the summarized results to a user. A two-week piloting dataset in a dense urban environment was collected with two low-cost positioning boards with the same hardware and firmware configuration. It was shown in previous research that the signal-to-noise ratio measurement is a sufficient metric to distinguish not only between indoor and outdoor environments, but to detect signal jamming events and to characterise the quality of the GNSS signal reception in the area. The uniformity of the configuration of the devices allowed for reliable spatial mapping of the signal-to-noise-ratio measurements. The novel contributions of this paper are as follows. First, the implemented architecture capable of continuous real-time context mapping is described. Second, a context map-aided measurements noise adjustment algorithm is designed. Third, the benefits of the context-database-aiding are demonstrated in the case of pure GNSS coordinate determination.},

  abstract = {GNSS remains one of the key building blocks in mass-market positioning applications, many of which require a high level of accuracy, integrity and availability. Conventionally, the GNSS receiver and antenna are a part of a multisensor integrated solution with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) at the core of the navigation system. One of the multisensor fusion challenges is to continuously adjust the Kalman filter stochastic model to reflect the environment of operation. Apart from poor satellite geometry, the reception of multipath-contaminated signals is the main factor contributing to GNSS performance degradation in urban areas. Signal quality monitoring (SQM) techniques are implemented to first detect and then exclude, de-weight or correct the multipath-contaminated GNSS measurements to minimize the impact of multipath-induced errors on the multisensor data fusion filter performance. The implementation of such an approach for kinematic scenarios in deep urban canyons with mass-market hardware suffers from high rates of false-positive and false-negative multipath detection due to frequent cycle slips, discontinuous satellite tracking, and a complex multipath environment. The alternative approach for the IMU/GNSS integration filter stochastic model tuning is to extract the a priori statistics characterizing the probability of the multipath-contaminated signal reception from a GNSS multipath environment map. The map is generated with collectively recorded carrier-to-noise-density ratio (C/N0) readings streamed from the connected vehicles operating in a given urban area and assigned to a space-time cube. While improving positioning accuracy, the application of the concept is constrained by the GNSS multipath environment map availability only to the areas directly surveyed by the connected vehicles.},

Such OFDM signals suit navigation applications thanks to build-in symbol sequences which despite being designed for communication services since are known at the receiver can be exploited for pseudorange computation. By using multiple numerologies, 5G is putting into place an important degree of flexibility which was not explored before. It turns out, the numerology counts towards the signal tracking performance. However, the nominal tracking capacity expressed by 5Gmicrowave signals at the highest sampling frequency is reduced due to the lack of full bandwidth useful signals. Top-ranked LTE-CRS performance can hypothetically improve by aggregating multiple carrier components.},

The proposed technique –cooperative binocular stereopsis – leverages the ability of one vehicle to reliably localize itself relative to the other vehicle using image data which enables motion estimation from tracking the three dimensional positions of common features. Unlike popular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques, the method proposed in this paper does not require that the positions of features be carried forward in memory. Instead, the optimal vehicle motion over a single time interval is estimated from the positions of common features using a modified bundle adjustment algorithm and is used as a measurement in a delayed state extended Kalman filter (EKF). The developed system achieves improved motion estimation as compared to previous work and is a potential alternative to map-based SLAM algorithms.},

The navigation system is reconfigured according to the recognized environment and behavior in the context adaptive navigation system. When the context adaptive navigation system is used, performance of the conventional navigation system can be substantially improved. When the vehicle rotates with a high rate which cannot be measured by a gyroscope, the gyro-free inertial navigation system can be configured in order to provide navigation information of the vehicle using a gyro-free inertial measurement unit which consists of only accelerometers. However, when the angular velocity is near zero, the angular velocity cannot be accurately estimated. And, since the angular velocity of the vehicle is not always beyond the limit of gyroscope measurement, better navigation results can be obtained if the available gyroscope measurements are used. In this paper, a context adaptive GPS/GF-INS integrated navigation system is proposed, in which rotational motions are classified and the navigation system is reconfigured according to the classified rotational motion in order to have more accurate navigation results. Results of the proposed context adaptive GPS/GF-INS integrated navigation system are compared with those of the GPS/GF-INS integrated navigation system. The results show that the proposed context adaptive GPS/GF-INS integrated navigation system gives better navigation performance and angular velocity estimation performance.},

  abstract = {In Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS), the ground and the airborne uses the same magnitude of time constants for the carrier smoothing filter. This is to avoid the relative errors induced by the ionospheric divergence according to Minimal Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) airborne requirement [1]. This is especially true for a single-frequency GBAS solutions such as GBAS Approach Service Types -C and -D, which are to support the Category (CAT) I and CAT II/III precision approaches, respectively. However, in a dual-frequency and multi-constellation GBAS solution GAST-F, which is currently under development within the frame of Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) project, the ionospheric delay is completely eliminated through the Ionosphere-Free (IF) mode processing. Therefore, this might allow the airborne side to have flexible time constants of the carrier smoothing filter. In general, using larger time constant for a carrier smoothing filter is more effective in decreasing the standard deviation of the pseudorange measurements when the measurement error is assumed Gaussian. However, in reality, there exists a time-correlated error, namely a multipath error in the measurement, which limits the reduction of a standard deviation of the filtered measurement. Even with this, having the longer time constants would be beneficial to reduce the noise and multipath errors under the assumption that the mean of the multipath error is close to zero. Despite of having this merits of using larger time constant, it should be careful to change the time constant at the airborne, because the impact of the range error is related to the compliance of the monitor performance to the requirement, especially for the GBAS solutions that support CAT II/III [2]. In this paper, we analyze the impact of using nonhomogeneous time constants at the ground and the airborne, especially on the compliance of the ranging source monitor for the Code-Carrier Divergence (CCD) and for the signal deformation faults.},

Therefore, the dedicated design of receivers for challenging environments is needed. In this paper, a Look-Up Table (LUT)-based adaptive Digital Phase Locked Loop (DPLL) is proposed. It continually adjusts the noise bandwidth of the DPLL properly by continuously measuring current C/N0 and jerk dynamic stress. Because it contains the LUT that has several pre-computed noise bandwidth values, an additional calculation process of the appropriate noise bandwidth value is not needed. Therefore, the receivers simply get the proper noise bandwidth value from LUT in a short time for stable operation. Numerical simulations configured using the moon exploration mission trajectory show that the proposed algorithm maintains tracking of the signal parameters successfully even in the harsh environment simulation scenarios such as the low signal power and/or high dynamics regions, while the conventional fixed noise bandwidth method may lose its lock.},

  abstract = {Navigation is the ability to be able to determine own position, orientation and velocity relative to a known reference point. Over the past couple of decades, there have been a number of navigation trends to improve the ability to navigate in all environments. Today the desire is to have an integrated navigation awareness composed of multiple interdependent systems. In this study a data fusion based precision positioning system that works in coordination with a Moving Digital Map is proposed. Accurate position estimation along with accurate mapping function provides effective passive terrain awareness for airborne platforms. The sensor fusion considered in this study combines data from an Inertial Navigation System (INS), Digital Terrain Elevation Database and measurements from a radar altimeter with as well as a barometric altimeter. This paper illustrates the theory behind and describes the algorithm details employed in the high accuracy navigation system and also present simulation results obtained while evaluating the system performance.},

  abstract = {Information cross-validation can be a powerful tool to detect manipulated, dubious GNSS data. A promising approach is to leverage time obtained over networks a mobile device can connect to, and detect discrepancies between the GNSSprovided time and the network time. The challenge lies in having reliably both accurate and trustworthy network time as the basis for the GNSS attack detection. Here, we provide a concrete proposal that leverages, together with the network time servers, the nearly ubiquitous IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) infrastructure. Our framework supports application-layer, secure and robust real time broadcasting by Wi-Fi Access Points (APs), based on hash chains and infrequent digital signatures verification to minimize computational and communication overhead, allowing mobile nodes to efficiently obtain authenticated and rich time information as they roam. We pair this method with Network Time Security (NTS), for enhanced resilience through multiple sources, available, ideally, simultaneously. We analyze the performance of our scheme in a dedicated setup, gauging the overhead for authenticated time data (Wi-Fi timestamped beacons and NTS). The results show that it is possible to provide security for the external to GNSS time sources, with minimal overhead for authentication and integrity, even when the GNSS-equipped nodes are mobile, and thus have short interactions with the WiFi infrastructure and possibly intermittent Internet connectivity, as well as limited resources.},

GNSS receivers, as part of the encompassing platform, can leverage external information to detect GNSS attacks.

In this work, we explore the combination of secure remote, network-based time providers and local precision oscillators. This multi-layered defense mechanism detects GNSS attacks that induce even small time offsets, including attacks mounted in cold start. Our system does not require any modification to the current structure of the GNSS receiver, it is agnostic to the satellite constellation and the attacker type. This makes time-based data validation of GNSS information compatible with existing receivers and readily deployable.},

This paper examines the spatial dependence of ionospheric disturbances that have threatened the accuracy and reliability of position estimates derived from these data over the period 2000 – 2019. We address two distinct aspects of this spatial dependence: (1) the geographic distribution of these threats, in particular, in relation to geomagnetic latitude, and (2) the geometric dependence of threats relative to the locations of the receiver sites that comprise the WAAS network. We analyze threat distributions in terms of the various means that WAAS employs to mitigate these threats, including the Extreme Storm Detector, the Moderate Storm Detector, local irregularity detectors, and the ionospheric threat model. Distinct distributions are presented for threats occurring in Solar Cycle 23 and those of Solar Cycle 24. To study the geometric dependence of threats on receiver locations, we use as a metric the distance separating a threat from the centroid of the nearest Ncentroid receivers. Large values of this metric identify threats at or beyond the edge of coverage. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for WAAS operations.},

  abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) location engines on Android devices provide incredible location and navigation utility to billions of people worldwide. However, these location engines currently have little to no protection from accidental or intentional tampering that could block service or even spoof the reported location. External sources of radio frequency interference (RFI) can jam or spoof GNSS signals, and a mock location can also be provided through software alone. The Android platform provides many native location metrics that can be used to detect and potentially mitigate these attacks. The GNSS Alarm Android application is being developed to test and implement various methods of spoofing/jamming detection. The application will be a standalone suite that provides multiple flags corresponding to each method with a target to provide to the public for testing and application pending further development. The app uses four different methods to detect attacks: comparing the GNSS and Network locations, checking the Android mock location flag, comparing the GNSS and System times, and observing the automatic gain control (AGC) and carrier to noise density (C/N0) signal metrics. The limitations of each testing method are explored, and potential improvements to the app are discussed.},

  abstract = {For the higher level of automation, accuracy of navigation states estimation is crucial demand. To achieve full and reliable navigation evaluation, trustable reference system needs to be developed. Although the presence of reference system of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) with global navigation satellite system (GNSS) through the multi-sensor fusion scheme was integrated, but in GNSS-denied or challenging environment, the navigation solution could not be accurately estimated and still needs to be fixed. This paper proposes new strategies for better estimating the LiDAR-based position uncertainty and updating the reference system. The first strategy involves determining the appropriate position error covariance matrix based on the Hessian matrix and the scale of covariance obtained from normal distribution transform (NDT) scan matching technique, and the geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) computed from the distribution of point cloud segments in each scan. In the second proposed strategy, the updated reference system was post-processed according to the loosely coupled INS/GNSS/NDT integration scheme with the forward and backward smoothing process. Preliminary results indicate that the updated reference system obtained from proposed strategy not only provides more reliable navigation estimation compared to an existing reference system from commercial software but also can be used for accurate evaluation of positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) with automated vehicle applications.},

It aims at providing better than 20m positional accuracy in the targeted coverage area. At present there are seven active satellites operated from the desired orbits with an operational name as NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation). NavIC offers Standard Positioning Service (SPS) for civilian applications on both L5 (1176.45MHz) and S (2492.028MHz) bands. India, being at low latitude region, the received NavIC signals at the antenna gets adversely effected by travelling through the ionospheric layer and may observe substantial error in pseudoranges. Since the difference between these two frequencies is large, that is frequency of S signal is more than the frequency of L5 signal by 1315.578MHz, L5 signal undergoes more code phase delay than S signal. There are still challenges in design and development of antenna and low-cost RF-frontend for simultaneous reception of NavIC L5 and S band signals. So, the main objective of this work is limited to investigate the capability of NavIC software receiver for single frequency ionospheric corrections and compare both signals.},

  abstract = {A new integrity monitor for the excessive acceleration threat is described, and its performance with respect to probability of missed detection for a given false alarm rate is derived. The monitor is based on carrier phase measurements. Data collected from a prototype GAST D installation at Frankfurt airport were used to verify that the monitor meets the requirements with respect to false alarms at real operating conditions. Cycle slips caused by overflights were shown to create heavy tails in the distribution of the metric, which can be mitigated by better siting of the reference antennas and improved cycle slip detection. A recently described class of carrier phase anomalies also creates non Gaussian tails in the noise of the metric, but these effects can be mitigated by increasing the threshold and noise parameter. A framework is proposed for quantifying the monitor performance in the presence of phase scintillations, which is a third disturbance that can create heavy tails in the distribution. Phase scintillations are most commonly observed at high latitudes, but can move south during an ionospheric storm. Data collected at 71 degrees latitude during an ionspheric storm in 2011 is used together with a derived risk model based on the Rate of TEC Index (ROTI) to quantify the false alarm rate of the monitor at different latitudes.},

Thanks to GNSS, it could be possible to realize cost-effective solutions to increase the safety in the regional lines, where the traffic density is lower. The train position estimation is implemented taking into account that the train is constrained to lie on the track (i.e. track constraint). In this way, we can express the position in terms of the curvilinear abscissa (progressive mileage) of the track corresponding to the train position. However, the impact of local effects such as multipath, foliage attenuation and shadowing in the railway environment plays a crucial role due to the presence of infrastructures like platform roofs, side walls, tunnel entrances, buildings and so on close to the trackside. In the paper, we analyse the impact of those threats on the train GNSSbased position estimation performance. At this aim, several scenarios have been generated by using both real data acquired on a railway test-bed in Sardinia, and synthetic data generated in the lab through ad hoc multipath and foliage models.},

After some years of development, the first ground stations have recently been approved for Cat. I operations (e.g. in Bremen, Germany). Nevertheless support for precision approaches with a decision height of less than 200 ft is a crucial requirement especially for larger airports. Thus, the GBAS community has introduced the GBAS Approach Service Type D (GAST-D) that provides sufficient performance in order to allow Cat. II/III operations using single-frequency GPS. Other than for GBAS Cat. I, the GBAS ground facility is not responsible for mitigating all possible hazards for GBAS integrity, but shares the responsibility with the airborne GBAS receiver. Due to this, a GAST-D capable aircraft receiver is much more complex than for GBAS Cat. I. In this paper, the components required for such a receiver are explained and combined into a generic GAST-D airborne processing scheme. Two different implementations using this scheme are presented. Finally, based on an experimental GAST-D ground facility in Braunschweig (Germany), some validation results are presented as well.},

  abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have the potential to substitute or support conventional methods for inspection and monitoring of natural or artificial structures in challenging scenarios. However, open challenges in the autonomous navigation and guidance remain if the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) can not be employed because the reception of the signals is denied or unreliable. This often happens in cluttered natural environments, such as gorges and steep valleys, or near to tall civil engineering structures such as dams and bridges. In these cases, the position fix is intermittent, can be biased because of multi-path effects, and the change of the constellation of visible satellites can cause sudden, undesirable shifts in the position solution. In this work we propose a method to solve the position control of an UAV in such scenarios, exploiting the fact that open sky is available above the object of interest. The system is composed of two UAVs: the first one flies higher in the open sky, where an optimal GNSS constellation is available. The second one performs the close range inspection without relying on any GNSS receiver. Instead, its position is determined by the first one by optical tracking and it is sent to the second one in real-time and with low latency to close the position control loops. We present a detailed description of the system and discuss its first experimental evaluation.},

  abstract = {Modern navigation applications are confronting the challenge of path identification and prediction. Because of the inherent noisiness of measurement techniques, positional data often contains errors. Over time, when attempting to predict future positions, these errors can compound, causing drift in the target’s path. Filtering or regression techniques can use periodic high-fidelity measurements, like those from GPS sensors, to correct positional data and reduce historic errors. These techniques have been much less effective in specialized environments where GPS is intermittent or denied. At the same time, the development of semi- and fully-autonomous systems has increased the need for accurate predictive navigation. To address this problem, previous methods were proposed for repairing tracking data using causality-aware machine learning (ML). It combined a long short-term memory (LSTM) network that predicted target paths with the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII) which identified and evaluated counterfactual paths. Here te authors expand on that work by improving the simulated data used to train and test the system, expanding the GA by adding additional first principles-based objective functions, improving upon the LSTM implementation, and utilizing Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) pre-processing. System testing is conducted on Matlab-generated navigation scenarios, and results are compared to both EKF correction and spline interpolation. The proposed counterfactual track repair (CTR) tool produces paths with less repeatability than traditional approaches. However, it is shown to consistently generate more realistic path corrections, lower error in predictions based on its corrected paths, and is highly configurable, demonstrating the value and utility of this approach.},

This paper aims to contribute to the alternative integrity approach based on interval and set-representations for bounding and propagating system uncertainty. Several key aspects are addressed: how to determine interval bounds to handle GNSS multipath effect in urban environment, how to realize fault detection and exclusion based on constraint satisfaction and set-membership, and how to improve the detector using weighting models. Simulated and real-world experiments are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of proposed methods. In this way, the alternative integrity approach will contribute to future autonomous navigation applications.},

  abstract = {Integrity monitoring is of great importance for Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) applications. Unlike classical approaches based on probabilistic assumptions, the alternative interval-based integrity approach depends on deterministic interval bounds as inputs. Different from a quadratic variance propagation, the interval approach has intrinsically a linear uncertainty propagation which is adequate to describe remaining systematic uncertainty. In order to properly characterize all ranging error sources and determine the improved observation interval bounds, a processing scheme is proposed in this contribution. We validated for a first time how the sensitivity analysis is feasible to determine uncertainty intervals for residual ionospheric errors and residual tropospheric errors, taking advantage of long-term statistics against reference data. Transforming the navigation problem into a convex optimization problem, the interval bounds are propagated from the range domain to the position domain. We implemented this strategy for multi-GNSS positioning in an experiment with static data from International GNSS Service (IGS) station Potsdam (POTS) and an experiment with kinematic data from a measurement campaign conducted in the urban area of Hannover, Germany, on August 26, 2020.},

  abstract = {The monitoring and prediction of ionospheric electron density is of great significance for ionospheric physics research and navigation positioning technology. Based on the observed slant total electron content (STEC) along different satellite-receiver rays, computerized ionospheric tomography (CIT) is used to reconstruct the 3-D electron density. In this paper, the fourdimensional imaging and short-term prediction of electron density of ionosphere are studied. A data-driven tomography and prediction method has been achieved, which combines the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the ionospheric electron density. Firstly, the data-driven sparse ionospheric tomography method will be used to achieve 4D electron density with high spatial and temporal resolution. Secondly, the prediction of electron density at hour level are constructed by LSTM neural network based on the tomography data set. Thirdly, the dSTEC error of the independent reference station is adopted to compare the prediction accuracy based on the LSTM model. The proposed tomography and prediction method will be verified based on real measurement of GNSS data in Hainan, China collected from Qianxun ground-based augmentation system on October 26, 2020. The temporal and spatial variation of ionospheric electron density with 5 minutes temporal resolution can be constructed by the data-driven compressed sensing method, and can be predicted by the LSTM neural network. There is a corresponding relationship between ionospheric electron density by the tomography method and the S4 parameters at Sanya station. The RMSE of dSTEC of the prediction model is about 0.6 TECU. The relative error of 50 minute short-term prediction is about 3.5\%. The ionospheric electron density prediction method proposed in this paper is expected to be used to realize real-time and accurate ionospheric monitoring and prediction in China.},

This paper presents the performance analysis of a dual-frequency dual-constellation (DFDC) ground-based augmentation system (GBAS) using modernized signals under nominal and anomalous ionospheric conditions. Because the characteristics of these new signals differ from those of older signals, the performance of the modernized signals must be evaluated before prototype algorithms can be used. We calculate the standard deviations of the multipath and noise errors for different signals. The results indicated that the standard deviations for GPS L5 were greater than those for GPS L1. The availability of the DFDC GBAS with the modernized signals under nominal conditions was over 99.99\% with divergence-free smoothing.

  abstract = {To keep the protection level low and meet the integrity requirement at the same time, we developed a dual-constellation groundbased augmentation system (GBAS) prototype to integrate the BeiDou navigation satellite system (BDS) into the current GPS-based GBAS algorithm. The measurements from the satellites are affected by the ionosphere. Thus, the objective of this work is to resolve these ionosphere issues by utilizing a dual-frequency dual-constellation (DFDC) GBAS prototype. According to the work presented by Stanford GPS Laboratory, two types of dual-frequency carrier-smoothing methods were implemented in the DFDC GBAS prototype, namely the divergence-free (DFree) smoothing method and the ionosphere-free (IFree) smoothing method. Among them, the DFree smoothing method corrects for the effect of the ionosphere temporal gradient. The IFree smoothing method completely removes all ionosphere-related errors, and the residual ionosphere error after the correction is zero, but the noise level is increased. A DFDC GBAS prototype would achieve the required integrity by combining the DFree and IFree methods and switching between them based on the ionosphere conditions. There are three switching strategies. In the first strategy, the system only depends on the ionosphere monitor, detecting the faulty signals and changing the smoothing filter for these signals to the IFree method. The second strategy is computing both DFree-based VPL and IFree-based VPL and comparing them to determine which VPL is smaller. After that, the system chooses the better smoothing method for all signals simultaneously. In the last strategy, the system will switch all signals to the IFree smoothing method when the monitors detect any anomalous signals. The ionosphere monitors independently detect each measurement and exclude the signals affected by anomalous ionosphere. In accordance with the results of the monitors, aircraft can switch between the DFree and IFree methods. The field test results of the GBAS prototype including the single-frequency dual-constellation case, the dual-frequency single constellation case, and the dual-frequency dual-constellation case are presented in this paper.},

We propose a 15th order tightly-coupled INS/TRN integration algorithm using the proposed RB-PMF. This can improve the estimation performance of position error and velocity error than a previous loosely-coupled type. Simulation is performed to verify the performance improvement of the proposed algorithm, and the comparison results of the estimation accuracies and the algorithm execution time are presented.},

  abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) has been widely used in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) services. Nowadays, most of the road level applications can be fulfilled by current meter level system availability, such as route guide, fleet management and traffic control. However, meter level of system performance is still insufficient for advanced lane level safety applications. These safety applications requires centimeter/decimeter level positioning accuracy, with high integrity, continuity and availability include lane control, collision avoidance and intelligent speed assistance etc. Detecting lane level irregular driving behavior is the basic requirement for the lane level required ITS applications. The two major issues involved in the lane level irregular driving identification are accessing to high accuracy positioning and vehicle dynamic parameters and extraction of erratic driving behaviour from this and other related information. This paper proposes an integrated solution for the lane level irregular driving detection. Access to high accuracy positioning is enabled by GNSS and Inertial Navigation System (INS) integration using filtering with precise vehicle motion models and lane information. The detection of different types of irregular driving behaviour is based on the application of a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). The field test results show that sub-meter level accuracy can be achieved and different types of lane level irregular driving behaviour can be identified.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, the research topic on transformed domain techniques (e.g. time-frequency (TF) transform) has obtained increasing attention in interference detection for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers. Different time-frequency representations (TFRs), such as spectrogram and Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD), have been considered in interference detection for GNSS applications. The spectrogram approach presents the TF resolution trade-off problem according to Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, which provides poor TF localization properties. In order to deal with the TF resolution limitation with the spectrogram approach, the WVD has been adopted in interference detection for GNSS receivers. The WVD has many nice properties and provides nearly the best TF resolution among all the TF analysis techniques, but it presents severe cross interfering terms problem due to interaction of different signal components, which inevitably results in serious estimation error for the instantaneous frequency of the GNSS interfering signal.},

  abstract = {Polarization-sensitive array (PSA) can sense satellite signals from multiple dimensions and separate signals from interference according to various characteristics. Hence, the use of PSA improves the interference rejection capability of the global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Whereas it also brings a significant increase in computational complexity as there are more dimensions of array signal processing. Therefore, it is urgent to seek a method to employ fewer radiofrequency (RF) front-ends and antennas while still achieving superior anti-interference performance. In this paper, we investigate the influence of PSA configuration on interference suppression performance and propose an RF front-end optimal selection scheme for reconfigurable anti-jamming PSA with application to GNSS. Combining adaptive array processing algorithm and RF front-end selection strategy, we formulate the expression of the effective carrier to noise ratio (CNR) to analyze the performance enhancement generated by PSA reconfiguration. An approach is presented to solve the upper bound of the effective CNR to plot the trade-off curve between performance and cost, which can guide the selection of the optimal number of RF front-ends. Then another method is used to acquire the layout of the chosen optimal RF front-ends that can maximize the effective CNR. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness and high efficiency of the proposed PSA reconfiguration scheme.},

This approach differs from probabilistic residual-based (RB) or solution separation (SS) fault detection and exclusion methods utilized in the Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) and Advanced RAIM. In the basic positioning model, measurement-level intervals are constructed based on the investigated error models and propagated in a linear manner using interval mathematics and set theory. Convex polytope solutions provide a measure of observation consistency formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem. Consistency checks performed using set operations facilitate multiple-fault detection. Choosing set-emptiness as the detection criterion can alleviate the need for multiple test statistics. In this paper, we formulate the fault detection problem in the context of measurement intervals and propose a framework of integrity monitoring for the set-based detection. Considering a probabilistic error model, we implement the set-based detection methods and assess its integrity performance using Monte Carlo simulations. These evaluations will serve as a basis for further development of efficient estimators and integrity monitors.},

This paper investigates the combined use of Kalman Filtering and non-coherent integration for enhancing the sensitivity of the data-only tracking. The analysis is performed by using an in-house developed Software Defined Radio (SDR) including different tracking strategies. They are standard dataonly tracking, pilot and data-only tracking using Kalman Filtering with coherent and non-coherent integration, respectively. The proposed tracking algorithms are assessed by using both simulated and live data. A hardware simulator is exploited to generate signals with decreasing Carrier-to-Noise Power Spectral Density Ratio (C/N0) in order to assess the sensitivity of the different tracking approaches. Moreover, live static and dynamic data, collected under harsh environments, are exploited to challenge the different tracking strategies. The analysis shows that, for the test cases analysed in this paper, the use of Kalman Filtering with extended non-coherent integration is effective in bridging the gap between data and pilot processing.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a method that was declared as the winner of the Google smartphone decimeter challenge 2022 (GSDC2022), conducted on the competition platform Kaggle from May 3 to July 30, 2022. GSDC2022 was conducted to estimate the driving trajectory of a vehicle based on the raw global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data from smartphones. The GNSS data from smartphones have lower signal levels and higher noise compared to commercial GNSS receivers. Consequently, direct application of existing high-precision positioning methods, such as precise point positioning and real-time kinematic GNSS, is challenging. This study devised a two-step optimization method to optimize the velocity and position of a smartphone. In the first step, the states to be optimized were 3D velocity and receiver clock drift, which were estimated through the framework of factor graph optimization (FGO) using GNSS Doppler observations. The outliers of the optimized velocity were excluded. Further, the sections where the velocity were not obtained were interpolated to estimate the velocity of the entire driving trajectory. In the next step, the states to be optimized were 3D position and receiver clock bias, and the velocity and clock drift obtained in the previous step were used as loose constraints between the states. In addition, the time-differenced carrier phase (TDCP) was used as a high-precision relative position constraint, and an error-corrected pseudorange using a GNSS base station was added as an absolute position constraint. Following the implementation of the proposed method and its evaluation performed at the competition, the final score, mean(50\%, 95\%), was 1.382 and 1.229 m for public and private, respectively, which won the first place at GSDC2022.},

There are numerous situations in urban environments in which an antenna can receive non-line-of-sight (N-LOS) signals, such as the reflection or diffraction signals from invisible satellites obstructed by buildings. In this situation, the multipath signals from the invisible satellites cause a large positioning error, and it is difficult to mitigate the multipath error in the global navigation satellite system positioning. In this study, we propose a novel technique to detect N-LOS satellites using only consumer-ready visible-light fish-eye cameras.

  abstract = {In global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning, GNSS satellites are often obstructed by buildings, leading to reflected and diffracted signals, which are known as non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals. Such signals cause major GNSS positioning (also known as “NLOS multipath”) errors. In this paper, a novel NLOS multipath detection technique using a machine-learning approach to improve the positioning accuracy in urban environments is proposed. The key idea behind this technique is to construct a classifier that discriminates NLOS multipath signals from the output of the multiple GNSS signal correlators of a software GNSS receiver. In the case of an NLOS signal, there are no direct signals; the first reflected signal has low power compared to a direct signal. Hence, the correlation function is expected to be more distorted in the case of an NLOS signal correlation. We use this phenomenon to detect NLOS signals. To consider the change in shape of the correlation values of NLOS signals and their temporal variation, we propose a method for constructing a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based NLOS discriminator. Furthermore, we propose a method for applying the NLOS probability, which is the output of the CNN, to the positioning calculation. To evaluate the proposed technique, we conducted NLOS classification experiments using signal correlation data acquired at different locations in the Shinjuku area of Japan. We compared the proposed method with a method using a simple NN. As the experiment results indicate, the proposed method can correctly discriminate approximately 98\% of NLOS multipath signals, and the discrimination rate of the proposed CNN-based method is higher than that of the simple NNbased approach. Furthermore, we improved the positioning accuracy from 34.1 to 1.6 m using the proposed method and concluded that the proposed approach can increase the positioning accuracy in urban environments.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel positioning technique that can be used in vehicles and by pedestrians in urban environments in which large global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning errors occur because of multipath signals. In GNSS positioning, invisible satellites that are obstructed by buildings emit reflection and diffraction signals, which are called non-line-of-sight (NLOS) multipath signals. These cause major positioning errors in GNSS positioning. Thus, to mitigate NLOS multipath errors, NLOS signals must be identified from all the received GNSS signals. The proposed novel positioning technique can detect NLOS signals without using any external data and sensors to improve positioning accuracy in urban environments, where NLOS signals cause major positioning errors. The key idea behind this work is estimating the user’s position using the likelihood of position hypotheses computed from GNSS pseudoranges, which consists of only LOS signals, based on the analysis of pseudorange residuals. To determine the NLOS GNSS signals from the pseudorange residuals at the user’s position, it is in turn necessary to accurately determine the position before the computation of the pseudorange residuals; we solve this problem by using a particle filter. We propose a likelihood estimation method using the Mahalanobis distance between the hypotheses of the user’s position and these particles. The likelihoods can be evaluated using only the LOS pseudoranges determined from the pseudorange residuals. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique, a positioning test was performed in a real-world urban-canyon environment. Using the proposed method, the distribution of the particles converged to within 1 m of the true position after few iterations of resampling. The proposed method is suitable and effective for accurately estimating the user’s position in urban canyons, where conventional GNSS positioning can cause large positioning errors.},

  abstract = {The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) has recently been used for the autonomous control of unmanned vehicles. However, GNSS data is not utilized to its full potential for autonomously navigating vehicles in urban environments. This is largely owing to the possibility of the degradation of GNSS observables (e.g., multipath and poor satellite geometry) in an urban environment. The GNSS Doppler frequency can be used to derive an accurate velocity without the requirement for a base station. This velocity is quite tolerant to the strong multipath condition as compared with the GNSS pseudorange-based position solution. Thus, the Doppler velocity can be used to estimate vehicle trajectories. However, positioning errors accumulate over time owing to the error in the estimated Doppler velocity. To overcome the aforementioned issues, we leverage the advances made within the robotics community surrounding the pose-graph-based optimization and localization technique. The main idea of this study is that a loop closure of the pose graph is generated from a time-relative real-time kinematic GNSS (TR-RTK–GNSS) technique. The TR-RTK-GNSS is based on time-differential carrier phase positioning, which is a method comprising the implementation of a precise carrier-phase-based differential GNSS with a single low-cost GNSS receiver. As compared with the conventional RTK–GNSSs, we can directly compute the vehicle relative position using only a stand-alone GNSS receiver. The initial pose graph is generated from the accumulated velocity computed using a GNSS Doppler measurement. To cancel the accumulated error of the velocity, we use the TR-RTK–GNSS as the loop closure in the graph-based optimization frameworks. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique, two kinematic positioning tests were performed using an unmanned aerial vehicle and a ground vehicle. In conclusion, we can estimate the vehicle trajectory with centimeter accuracy in an open-sky environment and with a few tens of centimeters accuracy in an urban environment using only a stand-alone GNSS receiver. Based on the test results, we concluded that the proposed technique is effective for estimating the precise vehicle trajectory.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a high-precision positioning method using graph-based optimization with only a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) in an urban environment with GNSS multipath signals. GNSS has become an important core sensor for automatic driving and pedestrian navigation, and it is important to improve the positioning accuracy in urban environments where multipath occurs. We propose a novel graph-optimization-based GNSS positioning method. The feature of the proposed method is that it fully utilizes pseudorange and Doppler observations of a multi-GNSS constellation and constructs a graph to estimate position, velocity, and receiver clock biases. We also add constraints on past and current nodes of the graph using time-difference observations of the GNSS carrier phase. The carrier phase observations of GNSS have rarely been used for graph optimization. By adding a constraint with a precise carrier phase, we can improve the accuracy of position estimation. In addition, a robust optimization method is used to exclude outliers due to GNSS multipath signals and optimize the entire graph to achieve highly accurate positioning in multipath environments. We evaluated the accuracy of the proposed method by collecting GNSS data in a real urban environment using a vehicle. As a result, the horizontal positioning error of the proposed method is reduced to 1.37 m, while the conventional GNSS-only positioning method has a horizontal positioning error of 5 to 10 m, indicating that the proposed method can achieve high-precision positioning in a multipath environment.},

The proposed method implements sequential estimation using multiple hypothesis tracking. In the proposed method, an observed distribution of the GPS satellite signal is assumed to be a mixture of a Gaussian distribution of normal values and a Cauchy distribution of abnormal values due to multipath errors. The proposed method generates two hypotheses of the normal values and abnormal values. To limit the number of hypotheses, we introduced Gaussian mixture reduction based on Kullback-Leibler divergence. Experiments with real driving data show that the proposed method is more robust than previously reported approaches based on extended Kalman filters or optimization algorithms.},

  abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is the most commonly used positioning technology for many Location Based Services (LBS) including navigation. However, GNSS applications are limited to outdoors as GNSS signals can get blocked and attenuated inside or between buildings, making positioning unreliable, inaccurate or impossible. Blockage of GNSS signals may result in the lack of availability of the minimum of four satellites in-view at each epoch, for a single constellation GNSS positioning, and consequently, lead to a failure in the continuity of the positioning service. This is a particularly common issue in urban canyon and indoors. This paper proposes and implements a framework to handle this challenge by virtually distribute the antenna in space and time and accumulate the measurements while adding some unknowns to solve the synchronization and the position solution. To test the proposed technique, Virtual Spatial Diversity Antenna (VSDA), raw GNSS measurements are captured using an Android 7.1.1. running smartphone over the period of forty-seven minutes. Then the observations are accumulated until the number of measurements outcounts the number of unknown, i.e. three position components plus the number of epochs. The results of the GPS-only measurements for a relatively limited period of 47 minutes, where satellite geometry may not significantly change, prove the feasibility of solving position solution in presence of fewer than four satellites at each epoch using VSDA scheme, and achieving the horizontal and vertical accuracy of 47.16 m and 68.45m, respectively.},

  abstract = {It is useful and innovative to monitor the displacement of structures caused by seismic shaking and landslides irrespective of observation points by using a single piece of equipment to collect data for some construction companies, research institutes and so on. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers and antenna on the roof of a steel tower to monitor the displacement of a structure (caused by wind, other natural elements, etc.) have already been reported in Japan, but our study is the first study on low-cost GNSS systems that can be attached to the walls of a building to monitor movement. Specifically, this research focuses on the real-time monitoring of structure movement using wall-mounted, hand-held Real-Time Kinematic GNSS (RTK-GNSS) receivers. Generally, it is not easy to set the antenna on the roof of buildings, so this approach attempting to attach the antenna to the wall has an advantage of the aspect of the readily installing. RTK positioning is normally performed using expensive, dual-frequency, geodetic-level receivers and antennas because it is commonly used in surveying world. However, aside from its high cost, this type of equipment is not easy to procure. This study addresses this problem using a low-cost, single-frequency, consumer-level receiver, which produces comparable centimeter-level results. The methods presented use horizontal spread and statistical values to determine positioning results. Our work on the proposed monitoring system, with its robust RTK improvement method, will serve as a reference for monitoring the fluctuations and movements of structures in the fields of architecture, construction and so on.},

Conventionally, the FIX solution of Kinematic positioning is often used as an element indicating the reliability of the GNSS positioning result. However, there is a problem that FIX solutions with large errors occur in urban areas. Therefore, in this paper, two points of interest were prepared. One is that errors in GNSS are more likely to occur in the height direction than in the plane direction. Another is that the height fluctuation of the vehicle is small. Based on these, we proposed a method to detect highly reliable FIX solutions using height fluctuations during driving. According to the evaluation test, the proposed method achieved a decision accuracy of 99.9\% on Route A, which is an urban area. On route B in a dense urban area where the environment is more severe, the accuracy of the judgment was 99.7\%. Since these results were judged with higher accuracy than the ratio test, the proposed method is considered to be effective.},

The use of low-cost IMU tends to cause bias error. In order to achieve high performance even with low-cost IMU, GNSS correction is used. The evaluation tests were conducted using IMUs in various price ranges. The results of Allan variance of the IMUs confirmed that the higher the price, the more stable the bias and the better the performance. Therefore, using the proposed method, the dead reckoning performance was almost the same for all IMUs. This indicates that the correction effect of the inexpensive IMU is effective. We also evaluated the IMU stand-alone performance by virtually blocking the satellite signal. The results are confirmed to be independent of the IMU performance due to Allan variance. We expect that this phenomenon may be related to changes in vehicle motion and vibration.},

  abstract = {Ionosphere variability and disturbances affect the performance of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Knowledge of Total Electron Content (TEC) distribution in realtime is important to the study of solar activity. GPS networks are a valuable tool to provide TEC maps at a regional scale. This study presents a complete algorithm for near-real-time ionosphere regional mapping that emphasizes its implementation. The algorithm uses an ordinary kriging along with planar detrending to spatially predict TEC values. The differential code biases of satellites and receivers are retrieved separately from ionosphere parameters. The theoretical semivariogram function is chosen automatically from five parametric covariance functions, that is, spherical, exponential, Gaussian, Matern family and Matern Stein’s parameterization. A software package is developed and applied to 6 stations from Algerian Permanent GPS Network (RGPA) and 25 stations from IGS (International GNSS Service) network scattered over mid-latitudes of Algeria, Morocco and Western Europe. Hourly-data collected during January and February, 2014 are processed and 1°x1° TEC maps are obtained with 1-hour temporal resolution. The results show the efficiency of Matern family functions and, at lower level, Gaussian function, in fitting the TEC experimental semivarigram. To investigate performance of the spatial TEC prediction with kriging model, 10-fold cross-validation is assessed during quiet and disturbed conditions.},

The distributed cooperative positioning technology could increase the navigation and positioning accuracy, but the ranging/positioning error from any cooperative node will lose the effect. This paper presents a distributed cooperative positioning algorithm with factor graphassisted. It constructs the belief information model by ranging error and positioning error of cooperative nodes, then fuse the positioning information through the factor graph theory. The cooperative nodes can access or disconnect the cooperative network at any time, which effectively avoids the influence of the positioning/ranging error of the cooperative node. The algorithm proposed in this paper is compared to several existing methods from four aspects: ranging error, positioning error of cooperative nodes, convergence speed and mutation error. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has 30\% 60\% improvement in positioning accuracy compared to other methods under the same ranging error and positioning error. The convergence rate and mutation error elimination times are only one-third to one-fifth of the other methods.},

A microprocessor-based design is highly reconfigurable and easy to develop and debug but not low power enough for mobile applications. The software overhead in tracking loops implemented on a microprocessor can be avoided with hardware implementation of the tracking loops on an ApplicationSpecific Integration Circuit (ASIC). The low power asynchronous GPS baseband processor architecture in [1] achieves low power by allowing each subsystem to operate at its natural frequency without clocking and by employing arbitrated hardware tracking loops. On powerup, a host system initializes the receiver with system configurations, tracking loops parameters, and Doppler frequencies and acquisition power thresholds of six available satellites. An asymmetric acquisition scheme allows each channel to perform just code phase acquisition after initialization and to then track continuously.},

  abstract = {Direct position estimation is an alternative GNSS positioning method, which parameterizes the received satellite signals as a function of the target dynamics and solves the position, velocity, and time (PVT) quantities directly from the raw signal, as opposed to using observables. It is also recognized as a one-step positioning method, in contrast to the traditional two-step GNSS positioning method which first estimates the observables and then estimate PVT through those intermediate quantities. It has been shown that DPE outperforms the two-step method in low-SNR scenarios, where the early combination of the signals improve the receiver sensitivity and its exploitation of weak signals. This paper improves the existing DPE approach by modeling the carrier phase components in terms of the position of the receiver. In this new framework, termed Precise DPE (PDPE), a new maximum likelihood estimator is derived based on the proposed signal model. This article present the first results of PDPE using a real raw GNSS signal dataset, which is used to compare PDPE performance against DPE and two-step solutions. Results show that PDPE provides improved precision compared to DPE and, additionally, outperforms the two-step method in precision and sensitivity.},

We previously developed an analytical framework to evaluate the performance of Inertial Navigation System (INS) monitors against spoofing attacks, which is necessary for eventual clarification and certification of the INS monitor. In this paper, we develop and execute an experimental setup to verify the resistance of the monitor against worstcase GNSS spoofing attacks. The test setup includes generation of the worst-case spoofed code and carrier phase GPS signals (using a GNSS simulator) that feed the receiver through a cable without needing to broadcast via transmitter. Using these signals, the miss-detection rates of the Kalman filter innovations-based monitor, has been observed through a tightly-coupled integration of a tactical grade inertial and a standalone GNSS receiver on a static platform. The experimental evaluation technique in this paper is fundamental because it is the first hardware test to quantify spoofing resistance of a widely used IMU with worst-case spoofing signals. We realistically demonstrate that, even if the spoofer tracks the position of the receiver and filters the high-frequency tracking errors, the monitor is still capable of detecting that with low missed detection probability.},

  abstract = {GPS navigation in urban environments is prone to error sources such as multipath and signal blockage. However, if we consider several agents, it is highly likely that some agents have better localization capabilities due to different views of the sky, heterogeneity in sensors etc. Collaborative localization (CL) is a way to aid navigation in a multi-agent system. CL algorithms face challenges such as scalability, robustness to noisy sensor data and single point of failure, and operability despite limited inter-agent communication. In this paper, we present a decentralized collaborative localization algorithm which is asynchronous, applicable to sparsely communicating networks, and has minimal information exchange. Moreover, the proposed algorithm takes advantage of the variable visibility of the sky for different agents. We propose a methodology for relaying satellite information between agents to augment the set of visible satellites on each agent with virtual satellites, thereby providing more constraint equations to each agent. The methodology is based on coupling of agents’ GPS measurements with range-only sensors and is applicable to multi-agent systems with these modalities. The proposed method is validated on real world dataset involving an aerial vehicle, ground agents, and several range-only sensors.},

Using data of a conventional inertial measurement unit and the common strapdown terminology, the position of the atom wave packet is tracked in a newly introduced sensor frame. This enables a hybridisation of both systems. The sensor frame allows for an easier mathematical description of the interferometer measurement and makes integration into higher-level navigation systems possible. Equations for a hybrid IMU/CAI system with several arbitrarily placed sensor frames are stated, as well as a compressed Multi-Axis model, following current developments in chip scale atom interferometry. The atom strapdown is compared with another common hybridisation technique which utilizes convolution of accelerometer data with the interferometer response function. The comparison is supported by real data. The dynamic terms resulting from the transformation of the IMU frame into the sensor frame of the CAI are evaluated in simulations and further discussed. Finally, the implications of the findings for future hybrid quantum navigation systems are stated.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel headset tracking framework designed for extended reality (XR) applications. The growth of XR demands accurate and robust tracking mechanisms that are suitable for both indoor and outdoor environments and offer anchoring to a global reference frame. By loosely coupling a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm to a tightly-coupled carrier phase differential GNSS (CDGNSS) and inertial sensor subsystem, the proposed system aims to achieve centimeter-accurate, globally-referenced tracking that persists during extended periods of GNSS degradation. Collaborative and persistent XR experiences are enabled through accurate map creation utilizing a bundle adjustment approach for map generation and maintenance. Cloud or near-edge offloading of computationally demanding steps in the pipeline is explored to reduce the computational demand on the headset. Robust tracking performance is evaluated in terms of odometric drift under GNSS outages. This paper also explores the benefit of additional headset tracking constraints offered by direction-ofarrival measurements to nearby cellular base stations. Such measurements will become available as future wireless standards make increasing use of mmWave frequencies.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a method of tightly coupling carrier-phase-differential GNSS (CDGNSS) with terrestrial radionavigation system (TRNS) signals and data to build a robust positioning, velocity, and timing (PVT) solution for urban air mobility (UAM). UAM will require precise and robust PVT solutions that are resilient to interference and jamming. CDGNSS offers absolute positioning with high availability and sub-decimeter accuracy but cannot serve as the sole source of PVT for UAM because of its vulnerability to interference: a single potent GNSS jammer could deny UAM service across an entire city were GNSS the sole means UAM navigation. TRNS signals are stronger than those of GNSS and offer additional frequency diversity. Their multipath errors, although larger than for GNSS at street level due to the low elevation angles with which TRNS signals propagate from terrestrial transmitters, are manageably small at altitudes where UAM vehicles will operate. Thus, TRNS offers an attractive backup to GNSS for UAM. This paper explores two techniques for fusion of TRNS and CDGNSS: loosely- and tightly-coupled. The loosely-coupled technique fuses information from the two sensing modalities at the level of full PVT solutions. The tightly-coupled technique explored here fuses GNSS carrier phase and pseudorange measurements with TRNS pseudorange, Doppler, and calibrated pressure sensor measurements, together with inertial sensor measurements, to produce a unified PVT solution. Innovations-based measurement exclusion is applied to reduce the impact of GNSS and TRNS multipath errors and of pressure anomalies due, e.g., to ground effect at take-off and landing. Both loosely- and tightly-coupled techniques are tested on an aerial vehicle platform in an environment where both GNSS and TRNS signals are available. Error growth of the tightly-coupled technique during extended intervals of GNSS denial is studied to determine whether UAM service could continue uninterrupted when only inertial and TRNS measurements remain available.},

This last technique will be provided in the forthcoming Commercial Authentication Service (CAS) operating in the E6-C signal. Currently, an ‘assisted’ mode is being defined, known as Assisted Commercial Authentication Service (ACAS), which aims to authenticate the ranging signal without the need of storing any secret key at the receiver. This paper reviews the key aspects of this service and its implementation issues and analyses the different operating modes that arise from this implementation, identifying the possible threats to face off.},

In doing so, a multivariate formulation of the GNSS undifferenced observation equations of a PPPRTK network is presented, where appropriate one-to-one transformations to the parameters ease our analysis. Functions of the estimable slant ionospheric delays are shown to have distinct responses to IAR, ranging from zero (of a satellite-/receiver-averaged type) to very significant (of a double-differenced type). While the satellite-/receiveraveraged components of the estimable clocks and phase biases on a particular frequency remain unaffected after IAR, the precision of their single-differenced (SD) counterparts experiences improvement. In particular, the precision improvement gets larger as the geometry of the model gets weaker. This is, however, not the case with the wide-lane satellite phase biases, since their precision is almost insensitive to the geometry of the model. Supported by numerical results, our analytical expressions show that the precision improvement of the SD satellite clocks and phase biases increases as the number of stations increases. We also highlight the zero-correlation property between the double-differenced ambiguities and the code biases that get estimable on the third frequency and beyond.},

Such analysis is of particular interest for the ongoing standardization work of L1-L5 SBAS services. In this paper we propose a method to jointly estimate the analog and the digital distortions.

The impact of both satellite imperfections on the ranging performance of a Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receiver is assessed by means of analytical formulas which make use of the cross-power spectral density (CPS) between the distorted and the ideal signal, and of the power spectral density (PSD) of the nominal (ideal) signal.},

  abstract = {As U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) programs begin to incorporate vision aiding into navigation systems of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), it becomes necessary to augment laboratory simulators of the UAS with realistic video simulation. Laboratory simulation for testing of medium to large UAS is attractive for managing overall program expenses and for removing the constraints on test execution. The benign dynamics of typical UAS along with the availability of Commercial off-theshelf (COTS) scene generation software with good terrain datasets allows the Gray Eagle Modeling, Navigation, and Integration (GEMNI) laboratory and the U.S. Army Product Office for Medium Altitude Endurance (PM-MAE) to pursue a low-cost approach using a high-end desktop Windows simulator. The capabilities and limitations of this approach will be discussed. A general simulator architecture will be presented for the generation of synthetic video to model typical electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) fixed or gimbaled payload sources in applications where UAS are flying in standard airspace over mapped regions of land and at distances such that the map data resolution limitations are not significant.},

We apply a particle filter implementation of the Bayesian PHD filter to target tracking using both range and Doppler measurements from a simple non-directional receiver that exploits non-coo¨perative FM radio transmitters as its “illuminators of opportunity”. Signal-to-noise ratios, probabilities of detection and false alarm and bistatic range and Doppler variances are incorporated into a realistic two-target scenario. Bistatic range cells are used in calculating the birth particle proposal density. The tracking results are compared to those obtained when the same tracker is used with range-only measurements. This is done for two different probabilities of false alarm. The PHD particle filter handles ghost targets well and has improved tracking performance when incorporating Doppler measurements along with the range measurements. This improved tracking performance, however, comes at the cost of requiring more particles and additional computation.},

PPP processes dualfrequency pseudorange and carrier-phase measurements from a single user receiver, using detailed physical models and corrections, and precise GNSS orbit and clock products calculated beforehand. PPP is different from other precise-positioning approaches like RTK in that no reference stations are needed in the vicinity of the user receiver. The only observation data that must be processed are measurements from the user receiver. Another advantage of PPP is that since the GNSS orbit and clock products are by nature global, the PPP solutions are also global, i.e., the PPP approach works for a receiver located anywhere on or above the Earth surface, and the resulting position is referred to a well-known terrestrial reference frame (normally ITRF). PPP can be applied at post-processing level and also in real-time applications, provided that real-time input orbits and clocks are available. One disadvantage of standard PPP however is its relatively slow convergence time, which is of the order of half an hour for decimetric accuracy, as compared to nearly instantaneous convergence with centimetric accuracy in short-baseline RTK.},

  abstract = {The addition of new navigation signals is a major focus of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) modernization. New L5 signals are broadcasted from three Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites and one Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) satellite. An L5 signal has higher power, greater bandwidth, and higher chipping rate. On the other hand, the most advanced correlator for an L1 signal has been improved for a long time since the advent of GPS. Although the correlator for L5 signals has not been improved to the same degree, it is expected that its performance can exceed that of an L1 signal. When we think about future automobile highaccuracy navigation using GNSS, Real-time kinematic GPS (RTK-GPS) is one candidate that can produce precise positioning within several centimeters. However, RTK is very sensitive to multipath errors, and as a result, it is far from a perfect solution at present. It is known that the pseudo-range from an L5 signal is as robust against multipath errors as an L1 signal using the most advanced correlator. By investigating the multipath errors from the L5 pseudo-range, it is possible to predict the total positioning performance using an L5 signal. Thus far, the L5 pseudo-range has not been investigated comprehensively because satellites broadcasting L5 signals are few. Therefore, we investigated the performance of the L5 pseudo-range and the tolerance to multipath error. To estimate the multipath error for GNSS-based pseudo-ranges, we typically use the code minus carrier difference technique. However, it is impossible to use this technique for kinematic data because there are many cycle slips in urban areas. To overcome this problem, we propose a new multipath estimation method for vehicles in urban areas. We tested 4 experiments using both kinematic and static raw data and confirmed that our proposed method was useful to estimate pseudo-range multipath errors in urban areas. From these results, it was found that an L5 signal with a standard correlator has comparable performance against multipath errors to an L1 signal with the most advanced correlator used to mitigate the multipath error.},

Thus, modules, which are not directly dependent on data from each other, can run independently and applications can be parallelized on a basic level what is a major improvement for the performance of multi-sensor data fusion algorithms. This paper discusses the flow-based software INSTINCT, which is a solid framework for implementing PNT algorithms and helps to reduce development times by making algorithms reusable. It provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that makes it usable in research and teaching. Inside the software, a variety of file formats and sensors for IMU und GNSS data processing are implemented. The realization of an INS/GNSS loosely-coupled Kalman filter flow is discussed and the results are compared to a flow representing a single point positioning (SPP) solution. Finally, a performance study of the algorithm on a 4th generation Intel CPU is presented, demonstrating that real-time capabilities can be ensured even on older systems.},

However, the localization requirements defined by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) are particularly challenging to achieve, especially in complex environments such as urban scenarios, due to non-line-of-sight conditions, outdoor-to-indoor penetration loss, and multipath propagation. Such effects are detrimental to localization accuracy, especially at mmWaves. This paper introduces the concept of blockage intelligence (BI) to provide a probabilistic representation of wireless propagation conditions. Such representation is then exploited in soft information (SI)-based localization to overcome the limitations of conventional localization approaches. Localization case studies are presented according to the 3GPPstandardized urban microcell (UMi) scenario at mmWaves with fully 3GPP-compliant simulations. Results show that BI together with SI-based localization is able to provide a significant performance gain with respect to existing techniques in 5G and beyond wireless networks.},

  abstract = {To improve the provision of a global satellite navigation service, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) - Institute of Communication and Navigation - is proposing a next-generation global navigation satellite architecture named Kepler. Autonomous synchronization at picosecond-level is a fundamental component of the Kepler concept, achieved via two-way time transfer (TWTT) schemes enabled by optical inter-satellite links (OISLs). This level of synchronization is only achievable if relativistic effects are adequately considered. In this paper we present the synchronization scheme for Kepler: all satellites perform pairwise relativistic TWTT, providing relative clock offsets in a predefined coordinate time scale. These are then distributed across the whole constellation and are used as input for a space-based distributed clock ensemble. Each satellite realizes a local copy of the Kepler system time (KST) by steering a local oscillator, so that all satellites will tend to “beat” the same time, thus achieving a tight synchronization. We show how measurement noise impacts the final synchronization level, in two different designs of the Kepler architecture. Additionally, the impact of constant biases on the system time generation is analyzed. Finally, we assess the impact of the choice of constellation’s measurement topologies (open versus closed rings). The synchronization performance is expressed in terms of maximum time offset between any two satellites of the constellation.},

  abstract = {The quality of the positioning and time dissemination services provided by Global Navigation Satellite Systems is tightly coupled with the provision of a stable system time scale. The robustness of time generation is important to ensure the continuity of service without performance degradation. A well-established method to generate a stable and robust time scale is the composite clock approach. Here, the contributions from each clock are combined to generate a weighted average, the so-called Implicit Ensemble Mean. A clock ensemble offers an enhanced robustness with respect to a system depending on a master clock, since the IEM is less sensitive to failures of single units. The time scale generation can be monitored by employing Fault Detection and Identification techniques. These are based on statistical tests designed to detect and identify faults at single clocks. In this work, these techniques are applied to provide statistically rigorous fault detectors for an ensemble of clocks. The clock composition algorithm can be equipped with a number of statistical tests, which are applied to detect and identify abrupt events (e.g. phase and frequency jumps) and slow deviations from the nominal expected clock behavior.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a simple anti-spoofing technique applicable to timing receivers in smart grid applications. The likelihood of spoofing at each timing receiver is determined based on the direction of arrival (DOA) of the GPS signals. If they all come from one direction a spoofer is deemed more likely. The DOA of the spoofer is determined from the power ratio of the GPS signals on two antennas with dissimilar radiation patterns. Experimental results for both a spoofed and non-spoofed scenario are presented to verify the technique. An overall framework that applies to a network of PMUs is also introduced which combinesGPS anti-spoofing techniques in the physical layer within each PMU with a trustworthiness framework in the signal processing layer. This allows evidences from both layers to be combined to improve the performance of anti-spoofing.},

  abstract = {This paper presents field test results from a prototype GPS interference localisation system that uses spatially separated sensor nodes containing antenna arrays to localise interference using both Direction of Arrival (DOA) at each array and Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) measurements between arrays. The synergy between antenna arrays and TDOA systems are explored and it is found that antenna arrays bring many important benefits to TDOA systems. They can be used to improve time synchronisation between nodes by steering a null at the interference and beams at GPS satellites. They can also be used to steer a beam at the interference to improve its Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when estimating the TDOA between nodes. Finally the DOA measurements themselves can be used to localise the interference even for very narrowband signals for which TDOA becomes unusable. In this paper the use of the GPS signals themselves for array calibration is also explored, and the GPS signals are used to estimate the orientation of each antenna array, calibrate the phase errors in each antenna array and improve the synchronisation between spatially separated nodes. The experimental antenna array nodes developed are intended for integration into the GNSS Environment Monitoring System (GEMS) developed by GPSat Systems which consists of a number of low-cost sensor nodes that comprehensively monitor GNSS system performance in a given area.},

  abstract = {Indoor navigation as well as pipeline detection has been under attention in recent years due to the device and technology developments with various requirements from urbanization. Thus, GNSS-denied environments are the targets to complete the mapping constructions or positioning applications. In this research, indoor and underground environments are detected and spatial information is acquired by laser scanner as further Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) algorithm input. On the other hand, Inertial Navigation System (INS) is aided for improving position accuracy during scanning processes. The payload is mounted on either mobile robot or hovercraft in relative size of the regions based on the concept of Mobile Mapping System (MMS). Based on the Kalman Filter, the data from INS and SLAM can therefore be combined. The concept of the Kalman Filter is to minimize the variance estimations through conditional expectation. However, the uncertainties in the sensors and the effect of the gravity field lead to the errors in the navigation parameters. The drifting problems therefore mounting when the scanning time and distance increase. In order to reduce the influence from mentioned errors, optimal smoothing is included and different error models are under discussion in this research. Smoothing is a method to estimate the values with the measurements from both the past and the future. Once the captured position accuracy is enhanced by these additional methods, the laser scanner is able to provide accurate measurements to reconstruct the environments into the maps. This research provides the rigid/regular payload for various platforms in related scenarios with INS as well as the laser scanner and the combination of the sensors’ data depends on the synchronization of receiving time by Kalman Filter (KF). The main focus emphasizes the capability of the payload on different platforms for further applications and the ability of the algorithm for accurate positioning so far by individual constraints.},

Such a rapid spatial information collection capability has become an emerging trend in the technology of remote sensing and mapping application. In this study, a fixed-wing UAV based spatial information acquisition platform is developed and evaluated. The proposed UAV based platform has a direct georeferencing module including an low cost INS/GPS integrated system, low cost digital camera as well as other general UAV modules including immediate video monitoring communication system. This direct georeferencing module is able to provide differential GPS processing with single frequency carrier phase measurements to obtain sufficient positioning accuracy. All those necessary calibration procedures including interior orientation parameters, the lever arm and boresight angle are implemented. In addition, a flight test is performed to verify the positioning accuracy in direct georeferencing mode without using any ground control point that is required for most of current UAV based photogrammetric platforms. In other word, this is one of the pilot studies concerning direct georeferenced based UAV photogrammetric platform. The preliminary results in term of positioning accuracy in direct georeferenced mode without using any GCP illustrate horizontal positioning accuracies in x and y axes are both less than 20 meters, respectively. On the contrary, the positioning accuracy of z axis is less than 50 meters with 600 meters flight height above ground. Such accuracy is good for near real time disaster relief. Therefore, it is a relatively safe and cheap platform to collect critical spatial information for urgent response such as disaster relief and assessment applications where ground control points are not available.},

  abstract = {The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals have significantly been utilized in our daily life. High-precision positioning solutions in the urban canyon are demanding, and long coherent integration was being suggested as one of the potential solutions dealing with the challenges in urban positioning, such as enhancing the SNR by minimizing the squaring loss and suppressing the multipath signals, etc. However, the coherent integration time is limited by the data bit transition in the legacy signals. The Doppler drift induced by the user and satellite dynamic in long coherent integration also causes the receiver easily lose track. It may be challenging to bring the estimated signal parameters back to the tight pull-in range in the urban canyon. There are few works currently can be found that focus on dealing with the data bit transition and easily loss track issues in long coherent integration. In this study, the open-loop GPS L5Q signal positioning algorithm is proposed. The advanced signal structure of L5 provides a data bit free pilot channel. The channel is being utilized to perform open-loop batch processing instead of traditional closed-loop processing. The proposed algorithm is integrated into the SDR for outputting the SPP position and velocity results. The result has been shown the proposed algorithm provides a better positioning performance, especially in terms of velocity estimation.},

  abstract = {The Global Positioning System (GPS) is listed by the US Department of Homeland Security as critical infrastructure. These are essential assets that underpin much of modern society and that, if removed, would have a debilitating impact on our physical health or economic system. This is no exaggeration as GPS timing synchronization is used to coordinate stock exchanges, and as the navigation capabilities it provides are used daily by nearly every smartphone user. Despite GPS being listed as critical infrastructure, it is very easy to interfere with it. Radio frequency interference (RFI) in the form of jamming or spoofing is so incredibly accessible that emitters, made to work with car adapters, capable of incapacitating vehicle tracking exist despite them being illegal. There are several methods for locating RFI emitters, and power difference of arrival (PDOA) is one of the simplest and more raw ways of achieving localization. PDOA is generally used because it requires less data to provide a solution than other alternatives, can be effective against both jamming and spoofing, and works against a variety of RFI signals, such as broadband noise or continuous wave. This paper improves on the PDOA approach by incorporating the saturation of the receivers and the nearest neighboring receivers to adjust the non-linear least squares PDOA solution. Receivers are said to be saturated when their automatic gain control has reached their power floor. This means that if a receiver is saturated it cannot provide an accurate PDOA estimate because there is an infinite amount of locations within a region close to the receiver that the emitter could be located. However, when the nearest neighbors to the saturated receiver are taken into account the saturation helps weight the estimated location. The algorithm presented in this paper is tested using data from a government sanctioned event as part of an educational agreement between CU Boulder and Edwards Air Force Base. The algorithm is tested under both broadband noise and continuous wave RFI signals and proves it can improve PDOA estimation of the emitter location by a factor of 1.5.},

  abstract = {Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) are the main part of the integrated navigation for most of the aerial vehicles. However, the accuracy of an inertial navigation solution decreases with time as the inertial instrument (e.g., gyroscope and accelerometer) errors are integrated through the navigation equations. Therefore, different aiding techniques are used to limit the drift in these systems. One of the commonly used techniques is the integration of INS with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals. By means of this integration, the advantages of both technologies are combined to give a complete and accurate navigation solution. However, GNSS signals travelled from the satellites to the receiver are at a very low power level. This low power level makes the signals susceptible to interference from other unintentional or intentional signals transmitted in the GNSS frequency range. If the interfering signal is sufficiently powerful, it becomes impossible for the receiver to detect the low power GNSS signal. There are different types of interference signals like jamming and spoofing. GNSS jamming, also referred as intentional jamming, is when a jammer generates sufficiently powerful disruptive noise signals at frequency bands used by a GNSS system in order to prevent GNSS receivers from tracking signals and calculating reliable navigation data. As for GNSS spoofing, unlike jamming, deceives the receiver into calculating an incorrect navigation data by generating a false signal that is either created by a signal generator or is a replica of a real recorded GNSS signal. The need for Terrain Referenced Navigation (TRN) arises when these GNSS signals are unavailable, jammed or blocked. In recent years, research on the application of TRN to aerial vehicles has been increased rapidly with the developments in the accuracy of digital terrain elevation database (DTED). Since the land profile is inherently nonlinear, TRN becomes a nonlinear estimation problem. Because of the highly nonlinear problem, linear or linearized estimation techniques such as Kalman or Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) do not work properly for many terrain profiles. In our previously published works, we already presented the nonlinear estimation techniques that can be suitable for the solution of TRN problem. In this paper, we move onto the real-time application of TRN algorithm and present an overview of the real-time flight test results. Thanks to our previous research, a nonlinear filtering method namely the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) based on the Unscented Transform (UT) of sigma points is selected and utilized for the real-time solution of problem due to its simplicity and low processor capacity requirement. The designed UKF algorithm is used to provide essentially continuous terrain navigation through closed-loop estimation of navigation errors in combination with fixed-angle-mounted laser altimeter ground clearance measurements and onboard Level-1 DTED obtained from open internet resources.

A hardware/software co-design approach is adopted in the proposed receiver to provide an easy access to modify at will the receiver parameters such as RF gain, position update rate, correlator spacing, code/carrier loop noise bandwidth, and discriminator type. The digital Intermediate Frequency (IF) signal at the output of the Analog-to-Digital (A/D) converter is down-sampled by the Virtex-5 FPGA and sent to the Linux workstation via high-speed PCI Express (PCIe) link to perform Parallel Code Phase Search (PCPS) acquisition to enable a fast signal acquisition procedure. The results for the code offset and carrier frequency obtained from the acquisition engine are used to initialize the code and carrier Numerically Controlled Oscillators (NCOs). There are 64 tracking channels implemented on the FPGA, which are driven by the RF front-end’s master Chip-Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC). This setup provides two highly synchronous receivers. As the receiver is tailor-made for high-end research applications, the outputs of the correlator arms, code and carrier error, C/N0, navigation data, and RINEX output is available to the end-user. The resulting receiver is capable of acquiring and tracking all visible satellites with an elevation angle of 5 degrees or more and with Carrier-to-Noise Ratio (C/N0) in the range of 47 to 37dB-Hz.},

The positions of physical and virtual transmitters can be estimated jointly with the receiver position with simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). In our multipath assisted positioning approach called Channel-SLAM, the estimates from a channel estimator are used in a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter which implements SLAM. While the original Channel-SLAM algorithm is a single-user positioning system, we present a comprehensive framework for cooperative Channel-SLAM within this paper. Users cooperate by exchanging maps of estimated transmitter locations. With prior information about the locations of physical and virtual transmitters, the positioning performance of the users increases significantly. The more users contribute to such a transmitter map, the more increases the positioning performance. With simulations in an indoor scenario, we show that the positioning performance is bounded for cooperative Channel-SLAM in the long run.},

  abstract = {While multipath propagation has commonly been regarded as a drawback for wireless localization technologies, the spatial information contained in multipath components (MPCs) can be exploited for positioning a user. In multipath assisted positioning, each MPC arriving at a receiver is regarded as a line-ofsight signal from a virtual transmitter. We assume the locations of the physical and virtual transmitters to be unknown and estimate them jointly with the user position with simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). In a setting where multiple users move in the same scenario, maps of physical and virtual transmitters can be exchanged among them. However, these maps are in different local coordinate systems with unknown relative rotation and translation. The distances among transmitters within each map are exploited in order to find correspondences among transmitters in different maps. Based on the correspondences, the unknown rotation and translation parameters are estimated. This allows a user to exploit the information in a transmitter map received from other users, and hence extends our multipath assisted positioning approach from a single user to a cooperative radiolocation algorithm. In simulations in an indoor scenario we show that using a prior transmitter map decreases the user positioning error although the map is in an unknown coordinate system different from the user’s.},

  abstract = {In multipath assisted positioning, each multipath component arriving at a receiver is regarded as being sent by a virtual transmitter in a line-of-sight condition. These virtual transmitters can be used for localizing a user. In the general case, their locations are unknown. With simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), the locations of physical and virtual transmitters can be estimated jointly with the location of a user. However, the convergence time can be high. In scenarios such as malls or museums, multiple users travel through the same scenario on different trajectories. Different users can cooperate by exchanging maps of physical and virtual transmitters in order to decrease the convergence time and increase the positioning performance. Though, each user is in its own local coordinate system. When a map of transmitters is handed from one user to another, the relative rotation and translation of the coordinate systems of the two users need to be estimated based on the transmitters in the two users’ maps. Within this paper, we propose an algorithm to merge and update an obtained transmitter map with the transmitters estimated by the current user. We evaluate our proposed method by simulations in an indoor mall. In a crowdsourcing based approach, maps are handed from one user to another, updated, and handed to the next user. Our evaluations show that exchanging transmitter maps improves the positioning performance, although each user is in its own local coordinate system not knowing the parameters relating its own coordinate system to the ones of obtained transmitter maps.},

  abstract = {In multipath assisted positioning, multipath components (MPCs) are regarded as line-of-sight (LoS) signals from virtual transmitters. The locations of the physical and the virtual transmitters can be estimated jointly with the user position using simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We have previously introduced such an approach called cooperative ChannelSLAM, where multiple users cooperatively estimate the locations of physical and virtual transmitters. Such schemes typically suffer from a high computational complexity due to expensive signal processing, though. Within this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines multipath assisted positioning with fingerprinting. In the first stage, multiple users estimate their own locations with cooperative Channel-SLAM. With the channel estimates and the estimated user positions from cooperative Channel-SLAM, a deep neural network (DNN) is trained. In the second stage, users can localize themselves making use of the DNN. In our novel approach, the positioning error is in the same order of magnitude as for cooperative Channel-SLAM, while the computational complexity is reduced drastically.},

The “PASCAL” IC enables simultaneous reception of two independently configurable channels with up to 60 MHz bandwidth anywhere in the GNSS L-band range. Both channels use a lowintermediate frequency (IF) architecture. The IC was implemented in a Globalfoundries 55 nm CMOS process technology and has a die size of 1.88 mm x 1.70 mm. The IC is packaged in a 6 mm x 6 mm QFN48 housing with exposed paddle. All manufacturing process variations which are required by the foundry have been considered and are fulfilled. The front-end has been designed to achieve low power consumption and to reduce the front-end’s area within the whole GNSS receiver. The measured core current consumption of the front-end with a 4 bit Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) configuration is 80.0 mA for both channels activated with a 1.2 V supply voltage with an external LOs (1544 MHz and 1248 MHz) and ADC clock (250 MHz). Using this configuration, the front-end demonstrated a functional E1/E6 Pseudo-PRS receiver. The digital interface pads require a 1.8 V supply. Different power saving modes are supported that will be detailed in the paper.},

  abstract = {The GNSS PPP navigation solution has the advantage of not requiring local reference station infrastructure as in the case of the RTK technique and the accuracy of geodetic GNSS PPP solutions can reach the decimetre-level in kinematic mode. The recent emergence of low-cost, high-performance MEMS IMUs prompts the integration of lowcost GNSS PPP and MEMS IMU to improve accuracy and continuity of the navigation solution. In the past, research has been conducted to integrate high-end GNSS receivers with PPP processing and MEMS IMUs, or low-cost, single frequency GNSS receivers with point positioning processing and MEMS IMUs. The objective of this research is to investigate and analyze position solution availability and continuity by integrating low-cost, dual-frequency GNSS receivers using PPP processing with the latest low-cost, MEMS IMUs to offer a complete, low-cost navigation solution that will enable continuously available, high-quality positioning and navigation solutions, even in obstructed environments. Using a dual-frequency GNSS receiver mitigates the ionosphere refraction to a large extent. The integrated solution offers less than meter-level accuracy when there is a GNSS signal outage for half a minute. The results obtained using the tightly-coupled, low-cost, dual-frequency GNSS-PPP and MEMS IMU performs 30\% better than the low-cost, single-frequency GNSS-PPP with MEMS IMU solutions demonstrated in previous studies during similar simulated outages. These results encourage usage of such a low-cost navigation system in contemporary applications such as UAVs, pedestrian navigation, autonomous vehicles, etc. As part of future work, the algorithm will be tested and assessed in tunnels and downtown areas. Zero velocity update will be implemented to improve the heading estimate, while the vehicle is stationary. And further refinement of the tight-coupled solution will be performed with the latest low-cost sensors.},

  abstract = {Precise and continuous positioning and navigation in urban areas can be achieved using high performance and expensive GNSS and IMU technology. However, modern applications demand higher accuracy and precision using much lower-cost sensors. In this research, next-generation, low-cost multi-frequency GNSS, microelectromechanical (MEMS) based Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and a patch antenna was used to obtain decimetre level accuracy in a suburban and urban environment. To compensate for the low-cost GNSS hardware errors, Precise Point Positioning (PPP) augmentation, ionosphere constraining (IC) and the third frequency of GNSS were included while vehicle constraining/ Non- holonomic constraints (NHC) were used on MEMS IMU measurements. A unique combination of the low-cost hardware and software constraining was used to bridge the GNSS gaps in an urban environment to provide a continuous, accurate, and reliable position solution that is novel and has not been explored and published earlier. In the past, high-precision, dual-frequency (DF) GNSS PPP + IMU and low-cost, single-frequency (SF) GNSS PPP + IMU were examined and analysed in the PPP + IMU research area. The accuracy performance of the TF PPP + IMU with constraining algorithm was tested rigorously using various combinations of satellites such as individual constellations and a combination of constellations during the introduced GNSS outages. TF PPP and IMU demonstrates less than a decimetre-level accuracy in the presence of a sufficient number of satellites. During 30 seconds of introduced GNSS signal loss, the overall rms of TF GNSS PPP + IMU + IC algorithm is 10-40\% better than DF GNSS PPP + IMU, as the number of satellites available reduces progressively from 4 to 1. The addition of IC and NHC helps in improving the accuracy of the positioning solution during reconvergence after an outage. The decimetre level accuracy results obtained during partial GNSS availability indicate a significant step forward in the low-cost navigation area for applications such as low-cost autonomous vehicles, intelligent transportation systems, UAVs., etc. that demand a decimetre level of accuracy in all environments.},

  abstract = {Advances in aerodynamic and propulsive efficiency of future aircraft can be achieved by strategic installation of propellers near the airframe. This paper presents a robust and computationally efficient engineering method to estimate the load distribution of a propeller operating in arbitrary nonuniform flow that is induced by the airframe and by different flight conditions. The time-resolved loading distribution is computed by determining the local blade section advance ratio and using the sensitivity distribution along the blade, which is a property of the propeller in isolated conditions. The method is applied to four representative validation cases by comparing to full-blade computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and experimental data. For the evaluated cases, it is shown that the changes in the propeller loads due to the nonuniform inflow are predicted with errors ranging from 0.5 up to 12\% compared to the validation data. By extending the quasi-steady approach with a correction to account for unsteady effects, the time-resolved blade loading is also well approximated, without adding computational cost. The proposed method provided a time-resolved solution within several central processing unit seconds, which is seven orders of magnitude faster compared to full-blade CFD computations.},

In recent years, Doppler processing has been revisited for several applications, including precise velocity [3]; positioning with low earth orbit (LEO) satellites using carrier Doppler shift only [4]; combining signal-ofopportunity Doppler measurements from multiple LEO satellite constellations [5]; and solutions combining both pseudorange and Doppler measurements [6].

  abstract = {Tracking locations of vehicles such as forklifts in warehouses and factories is crucial since it contributes to the safety of personnel and the output performance of manufacturing and logistics activities. It is necessary to develop a method of locating the vehicles by attaching generic inertial measurement units (IMUs) without any modifications. In this research, we have aimed at providing technologies to estimate locations of the vehicles with the IMUs simply attached to the vehicles based on vibration analysis. We have also developed a novel method of automatic calibration between the proposed vibration signatures and the road conditions without any manual procedures. Integration of acceleration in short terms (within 0.5-2 seconds) and observation of vibration signatures in long terms ({$>$} 30 seconds) are fused in the extended Kalman filtering framework to stably estimate the correlation parameters and can also be used to detect changes in the road conditions. In this research, we confirmed that accuracy of localization is below 1-5\% of distance travelled on average for electric wheelchairs and handy wagons without any manual calibration procedures by using the smartphones. With aids of generic Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons, we also confirmed that the error of location can be bounded to below 2 meters on average.},

This system consists of the two-antenna GNSS receiver and a low-cost IMU embedded directly into one of the antennas.

These two angles are calculated from carrier phases of GNSS signals simultaneously received by both antennas in a common time scale. Inertial measurements are transmitted directly to the receiver from the IMU located inside one of antennas near its phase center. The RF cable is used to transfer these IMU data in conjunction with the GNSS signal received by this antenna. Measurements from the IMU are combined within the receiver with GNSS measurements of position, velocity and partial attitude. Operation principles of individual components of this integrated system are described.

  abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) underpin a number of modern life activities, such as air/marine transport, autonomous vehicles/machinery control and in areas such as construction, agriculture and offshore operations. GNSS signals are sensitive to a number of vulnerabilities, of which a one major shortcoming is related to the perturbations due to the Earth’s ionosphere. In particular, a phenomenon known as ionospheric scintillation, characterised by rapid fluctuations in GNSS signal amplitude and phase, may seriously disrupt satellite tracking and degrade system accuracy, reliability and integrity. The research presented in this paper was carried out under the “Ionosphere Prediction Service” (IPS) project funded by the European Commission (EC) under Horizon 2020, in the frame of the Galileo programme. The main aim of this project is to translate the forecast of the ionosphere into GNSS userdevoted metrics through the design and development of a prototype for an ionospheric prediction service. The statistical models developed to estimate the 3D positioning errors at the high and low latitudes as a function of scintillation levels are presented. The statistical approach of non-linear regression was applied on a long-term data set to develop these models. If scintillation information can be nowcasted, the developed statistical models can be used to nowcast the 3D positioning errors on a regional or a global scale, which can provide GNSS users with the expected error in the 3D position estimation under scintillation.},

  abstract = {Satellite navigation plays a critical role in new railway signaling and train control systems. It will allow higher levels of automation at a reduce cost in installation and maintenance as compared to current infrastructure-based technologies. However, in order to be integrated in railway systems, GNSS must guarantee the stringent railway safety requirements. GNSS safety has been extensively quantified for the aviation community, however, in the railway environment the probability of local GNSS hazards like interferences is larger due to its operation in a non-restricted space. Railway GNSS receivers must be therefore equipped with mechanisms to protect the position determination from being corrupted by undesired interferences (jamming or spoofing) without being aware of it. In this paper and based on Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware we implemented interference detection functions suitable for railway localization. We detail the algorithm design as well as the necessary calibration procedure to determine the nominal signal model. The performance of the interference detection is analyzed with an experimental setup on a commercial train during the measurement campaign organized for the EU project ERSAT-GGC. Figures about the detection capability and detected events along the selected line are finally provided.},

  abstract = {One of the more challenging propagation conditions in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), clearly affecting high-precision receivers and safety critical applications, is ionospheric scintillation. One of the main disadvantages of standard phase tracking architectures is the estimation vs mitigation tradeoff, that is, it is impossible to distinguish between the line-ofsight (LOS) phase contribution of interest and phase variations induced by the ionosphere. A possible solution is to consider a state-space formulation of the problem, where the scintillation amplitude and phase are estimated together with the LOS phase variations. The current Kalman filter-based techniques exploiting this idea consider an off-line scintillation model fitting, thus not suitable for real-life applications. In this contribution we propose an adaptive model learning strategy to be able to cope with timevarying unknown scintillation conditions. The performance of the new approach is shown using real ionospheric scintillation data recorded over Hanoi in 2015.},

  abstract = {The fusion of Inertial Navigation System (INS) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is a well established technique to provide resilient positioning even in GNSS challenged environments. However, when GNSS reception conditions are persistently degraded, the inherent drift of inertial navigation can result in insufficient accuracy (e.g. greater than 1m), especially when using industrial or tactical grade Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). This study introduces the tightly coupled integration of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) ranging measurements with fixed beacons to a loosely coupled GNSS/INS fusion. The algorithm uses an Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF) that supports Velocity Constraints (VC) and Zero-Angular Rate Updates (ZARU)/Zero Velocity Updates (ZVU). It details the necessary pre-processing of UWB measurements to correct for clock drift, velocity and latency errors, and provides two calibration techniques suitable for guided and generic use cases, resulting in ranging accuracy of better than 3cm and 11cm, respectively, based on 28 field tests. The benefits of UWB measurements in fusion are demonstrated through a field trial with severely degraded GNSS conditions, resulting in horizontal accuracy better than 40cm (compared to 2.1m without UWB) and improved rejection of poor GNSS measurements.},

  abstract = {A new recursive algorithm is proposed for jointly estimating the time-varying number of targets and their states from a sequence of observation sets in the presence of data association uncertainty, detection uncertainty, noise, and false alarms. The approach involves modelling the respective collections of targets and measurements as random finite sets and applying the probability hypothesis density (PHD) recursion to propagate the posterior intensity, which is a first-order statistic of the random finite set of targets, in time. At present, there is no closed-form solution to the PHD recursion. This paper shows that under linear, Gaussian assumptions on the target dynamics and birth process, the posterior intensity at any time step is a Gaussian mixture. More importantly, closed-form recursions for propagating the means, covariances, and weights of the constituent Gaussian components of the posterior intensity are derived. The proposed algorithm combines these recursions with a strategy for managing the number of Gaussian components to increase efficiency. This algorithm is extended to accommodate mildly nonlinear target dynamics using approximation strategies from the extended and unscented Kalman filters.},

Although the foundation has been established in the form of finite set statistics (FISST), its relationship to conventional probability is not clear. Furthermore, optimal Bayesian multitarget filtering is not yet practical due to the inherent computational hurdle. Even the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter, which propagates only the first moment (or PHD) instead of the full multitarget posterior, still involves multiple integrals with no closed forms in general. This article establishes the relationship between FISST and conventional probability that leads to the development of a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) multitarget filter. In addition, an SMC implementation of the PHD filter is proposed and demonstrated on a number of simulated scenarios. Both of the proposed filters are suitable for problems involving nonlinear nonGaussian dynamics. Convergence results for these filters are also established.},

  abstract = {Several navigation filters have been developed since the early steps of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) to provide high-accuracy Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT), and many solutions are available in the literature to support a plethora of applications. In the context of vehicular navigation and positioning, advanced state estimation and sensors fusion techniques cannot cope by themselves with strong multipath effects in dense urban areas. Therefore, these solutions require more robust approaches typically involving an additional processing effort, especially in low-cost Inertial Navigation System (INS)/GNSS Tightly-Coupled (TC) integration scheme. This work analyzes state-of-the-art covariance matrix estimation methods and proposes an INS-based pre-processing stage to mitigate the impact of undesired, multipath-related bias injections without inhibiting the Inertial Navigation System (INS)/GNSS integration. The proposed adaptive solution improves the overall stability and estimation accuracy of a set of Bayesian filters, i.e., Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), and Unscented Particle Filter (UPF). Results are presented about a real dataset in which an advanced, state-of-the-art Adaptive UPF (AUPF) TC scheme, applied to a low-cost integrated setup, occasionally failed to track the navigation solution due to poorly conditioned GNSS measurements.},

The first part of this paper gives a detailed measurement characterization of the Galileo performance parameters relevant for ARAIM users, with particular view on URA and Broadcast Group Delay (BGD) error overbound. This work is one of the important outcomes of the Integrity Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (IFMEA) that has been established for Galileo in the frame of the Galileo Open Service Safety of Life (GoSoL) work plan set up by the European Commission. The work presented in this paper has been conducted by ESA, EUSPA and EC together with industry. These results are an extension of the prior work presented on [13.] and [14.] considering an enlargement of the observation period for Galileo of approximately 24 and 12 months respectively. The additional monitoring period has corroborated the good performance on the SoL relevant parameters and the fulfillment of the target Psat, Pconst and URA as per Galileo SARPs [16.]. The second part of this paper addresses the Galileo ISM format that will be disseminated through the Galileo Signal-in-Space. This paper describes the initial design of the Galileo ISM message type, together with the corresponding processing logic at the user receiver. Additionally, the E1B I/NAV message stream broadcast by Galileo satellites, at a rate of one I/NAV word (128 bits) per 30-seconds sub-frame, can also accommodate ISM from other constellations.},

Further, there may be more advantageous ways to combine information from multiple frequencies, particularly when the ionospheric rates are small.

Specifically, we use the delay and Doppler information provided by the channel impulse response. Since the geometry of the vehicles has a direct impact on the delay and Doppler frequency, it is possible to deduce the relative positions of the vehicles. This particular relationship can be exploited by using prolate spheroidal coordinates. By doing an algebraic analysis in this coordinate system closed form solutions for delay and Doppler frequency can be derived. The delay and Doppler information is then used to determine the relative position similar to using the bearing and distance to a lighthouse in marine navigation or distance measuring equipment (DME) and VHF omnidirectional radio range (VOR) in aeronautical navigation.},

Authentication would protect the user against the possibility of undesired integrity data being mistaken for genuine State provided signals. Several authentication schemes have been proposed over the past years, but recently a preference has been expressed for inline signatures (i.e., signatures that are interleaved with the correction and integrity messages, all in the same data stream). An important concern is whether there is sufficient bandwidth to add these new messages and will their addition negatively affect performance. We have proposed a method that achieves this goal and evaluate its performance. Further, our method ensures rigorous protection for the user by ensuring that unauthenticated data is discarded and cannot cause harm to the user, while maintaining the required Time-To-Alert of the SBAS integrity messages.},

A conventional remote-controlled vehicle was converted into a robot rover and fitted with a single-line LiDAR that can scan for distance information on the terrain immediately in front of the vehicle. LiDAR data from four different types of terrain was collected and used to train a number of popular machine learning algorithms in order to find the model with the best performance for predicting unknown terrains. The results show that the Random Forest algorithm exhibits a reasonable classification performance, with 82\% accuracy with 10-fold cross validation, and 77\% accuracy when tested with a previously unseen dataset. The result indicates that LiDAR data can indeed be utilised to derive valuable terrain information for outdoor mobile robots. Further work has also been proposed to improve the accuracy of the prediction model.},

The proposed algorithm uses a novel adaptive attitude filter, cascaded with a velocity-position filter. First, the transition relation between additive quaternion error and attitude error is derived, and the attitude filter equation is established. Using the attitude information provided by MEMS-IMU and GPS, the additive quaternion error is calibrated to improve the accuracy of attitude. Then, the velocity-position filter is established to estimate the velocity and position. Cascading the filters, not only the navigation accuracy can be improved , also it can be applied to the situation of GPS outages. The results of driving test show that the proposed algorithm can enhance the precision of attitude, velocity and position estimation, it also effectively overcomes the shortcomings of low attitude precision during GPS outages.},

However, with the growth of its civilian applications, narrowing TTFF for GPS receivers is becoming a major topic of interest within the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) community. This led to the creation of Assisted GNSS (A-GNSS), which allows receivers to narrow TTFF through the use of a smarter acquisition strategy [1] combined with the ephemeris data. Ephemeris data includes all data necessary for satellite positioning, and is transmitted by a cellular network in an effort to avoid delays. Without it, users are forced to wait for a full frame broadcasted from navigation satellites, which usually takes 30 seconds for the GPS L1 CA signal. Instead, A-GNSS can utilize the existence of previously established ephemeris data to provide instantaneous positioning. With current cellular data rates, it is possible for A-GNSS receivers to access and utilize ephemeris data with no delays.},

  abstract = {Alternative positioning techniques, such as those using ambient signals-of-opportunity, have been increasingly developed for global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-challenging urban and indoor environments. For instance, cellular long-term evolution (LTE) network supports a variety of positioning methods based on signal measurements such as received signal strength or time-of-arrival (TOA). Carrier phase measurement extracted from LTE signals has also received substantial attention due to its potential high ranging accuracy. This paper presents a closed-loop (CL) carrier phase tracking architecture for positioning in LTE networks with robustness to the channel fading effects. The pilot cell-specific reference signal (CRS) is exploited for generating the channel estimation results, which are inputs for the carrier phase discriminator to measure the carrier phase error. The undesired bias corrupting the phase discriminator output for multipath channels is analytically derived. Then, the state-space model of LTE carrier signal tracking in light of the specific CRS time-frequency domain pattern is established and the state estimator gain matrix is derived based on the proportional integral filter deign. Simulation assessment of the proposed carrier phase tracking architecture is performed in a single path Rician fading channel under different Rician factors and signal powers. The impact of loop parameters, e.g., loop bandwidth and updating interval, is investigated. Real collected LTE data in a multipath fading channel is also used to comparatively analyze the performances of the existing open-loop and proposed CL carrier tracking methods combined with three LTE signal TOA estimators. The proposed algorithm in conjunction with the multipath estimating delay lock loop is shown to provide accurate and robust carrier phase measurements against multipath fading effects compared to other considered tracking schemes.},

Multiple antenna receivers have been considered to be effective tools for interference suppression in GPS. In open loop nulling and localization schemes, we proceed with accurate interference directionof-arrival (DOA) estimates which enable a follow-on effective interference suppression using available spatial degrees of freedom. In this paper, we consider sparse array configurations where the respective coarrays permit DOA estimation of a large number of interferers. The estimates are provided by using sparse reconstruction techniques. Guided by both minimum redundancy array and boundary array configurations, we design optimal placements of multiple GPS arrays on a regular Cartesian grid to achieve desirable performance.},

With the coherent GNSS-R carrier phase and high-rate carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N0) measurements, we can potentially achieve centi-meter level altimetry and high-resolution soil moisture monitoring, flood detection, etc. In this paper, we present two approaches, i.e., openloop (OL) and closed-loop (CL), to process the coherently reflected GPS signals. The CL approach is implemented with an adaptive Kalman filter (AKF) tuned by an empirical dynamics noise model and real-time estimated C/N0. Four segments of data, containing coherent reflections from coast area, shallow ocean bank, land, and a lake, are used to evaluate the tracking algorithms performances and the coherent carrier phase and C/N0 measurements.},

Raw GPS L1 intermediate frequency (IF) datasets recorded by CYGNSS satellites in the low-Earth orbits are processed using an adaptive hybrid tracking (AHT) algorithm presented in [6]. The AHT algorithm can effectively mitigate the cycle slips in the carrier phase estimations caused by signal amplitude fading while simultaneously reduce noise for both the pseudorange and carrier phase measurements through an adaptive filtering scheme implemented in the algorithm. Two examples from processing the CYGNSS raw IF data are presented in the paper. One example is a semi-coherent land-reflection event over Vietnam which demonstrates pseudorangebased land altimetry at meter-level accuracy as compared with the shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) digital elevation map (DEM). The second example is an coherent reflection pass over the Orinoco River. This example demonstrates the potential of GNSS-R for IWB surface height retrieval at centimeter-level precision and surface gradient at cm/km level.},

  abstract = {Currently, smartphones are the first choice for vehicle navigation. Due to the low quality of its embedded Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), some self-constrained technologies have been developed to reduce the divergence of error in GNSS-denied areas, such as Zero Velocity Update (ZUPT) and Non-Holonomic Constraints (NHC). Their rear wheels are considered as the active position of NHC, while smartphones are usually installed on a holder in the front of the vehicle to guide drivers. To ensure the effectiveness of NHC, there is an urgent need to calibrate the lever arms and the installation angles between the smartphone and the previously mentioned active position. The lever arm is relatively stable under most situations since the position of the phone holder in the vehicle is usually fixed, which can be measured by a tape measure or estimated by the parameters of the car directly. The installation angle is difficult to be accurately measured and it may change every time we install the smartphone into the holder. Excluding the roll angle that does not affect the validity of NHC, an automatic estimation algorithm of the pitch and heading installation angles is needed. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-driven automatic estimation of smartphone installation angles to enhance the performance of smartphonebased vehicle navigation in GNSS-denied areas. In the first step, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used to integrate GNSS/IMU/Barometer/DeepOdometry to provide accurate positions and attitudes. Simultaneously, the data of IMU and barometer are input into the trained deep learning network to output the predicted positions with the attitudes obtained from the integrated system. Then, the installation angles are estimated as states in another EKF by differing the predicted positions and the integrated positions. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method can estimate pitch and heading installation angles in deviation within 1 degree.},

A novel rotation vector calculating structure is proposed, in which the second-order coning correction is calculated using a downsumming structure at a fast updating rate, while the third-order and the fourth-order coning corrections are calculated at a slower rate than the second-order coning calculation. Simulations based on the simulated data and real experiment data are carried out to evaluate the performance of the new algorithm and the traditional algorithm. The results of the simulated large amplitude pure coning environment show that the attitude error of the traditional algorithm is extremely large expecially when there is non-integer-period cone motion occur for the platform. However, the proposed algorithm can overcome this large error. Twenty minutes' simulation by post-processing the real experiment data shows that, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm has no advantage over the traditional algorithm in the small amplitude pure angular vibration environment and pure large angular rate maneuvering environment. But, in large amplitude pure angular vibration environment and large angular rate maneuvering with angular rate vibration coexisting environment, the proposed algorithm perform better adaptability and has higher accuracy. Especially when the platform is in severe angular vibration and large angular rate coexisting environment, the advantage of the high-order algorithm is more distinct.},

  abstract = {In the past few years, ultra-wideband (UWB) as a new type of wireless communication technologies has drawn an increasing attention in the field of indoor positioning. Since the UWB has ultra-high temporal resolution, the time of arrival (TOA) and time difference of arrival (TDOA) based ranging methods have found wide applications in UWB positioning systems. However, the existing positioning methods suffer from performance graduation due to the problem of high-resolution clock synchronization and limited number of located users. In this paper, a pseudo clock synchronization scheme based on the signal communication mechanism is proposed to resolve the clock synchronization problem. Through two-way communication between base stations, the proposed scheme achieves accurate clock synchronization while it is easy to implement in practical applications. In addition, under the framework of the signal communication mechanism, the mobile tags only receive the ranging signal from the base stations passively. Thus, the proposed scheme achieves the ability of unlimited number of located users theoretically. To further improve the positioning accuracy, the least square method is exploited to compensate the difference of the time resolution. The superior performance of the proposed positioning scheme has been verified by indoor positioning experiment on a prototype UWB positioning platform.},

  abstract = {In the non-conservative driving force of satellites, the study of solar radiation pressure model has progressed rapidly, and the research on the earth radiation pressure is relatively lacking. In the high precision orbit determination, the impact of earth radiation pressure can’t be ignored for high area-mass ratio satellites such as the navigation satellite. In this paper, the principle and influence mechanism of earth radiation pressure are studied, and the method of modeling the earth radiation pressure perturbation is discussed. According to the characteristics of Beidou satellite navigation system, the reflectivity of the surface of the earth and the distribution data of infrared emissivity are used to establish accurate earth radiation pressure model. The model for BDS satellites was verified and the accuracy and reliability of BDS satellites’ orbit were evaluated by the global MGEX station observation data and regional monitoring station data. The experimental results show that the average 1D-RMS of the orbit is decreases by about 4 mm for the ERPM2 model and 2 mm for the ERPM1 model respectively, which orbit accuracy of several satellites has been improved up to 5 \textasciitilde{} 10 mm. The results of SLR validation show that adding the ERPM2 model improves the radial tracking of the Beidou MEO satellite orbit by 3.1 cm and improves the radial tracking of the GPS 036 satellite orbit by 0.8 \textasciitilde{} 1.4 cm. As a result, the earth radiation pressure model in the precision orbit determination of Beidou navigation satellites need to be paid attention.},

  abstract = {With the increasing demand for autonomous driving applications, accurate navigation solutions are required. Lane-level navigation needs to be developed to enable robust vehicle guidance. GNSS can provide a user with the precise absolute position, and the solution accuracy is independent of trajectory and time. Precise point positioning (PPP) is used widely because of its high positioning accuracy. In recent years, relatively fast convergence PPP has been realized with an SBAS augmentation signal. In this study, a multi-GNSS advanced orbit and clock augmentation (MADOCA) product was applied to enhance the navigation performance and shorten the PPP convergence time. The augmentation data provided correction messages for the satellite orbit and clock bias in the Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services (RTCM) state-space representation (SSR) format. The performance of static PPP combining broadcast ephemeris with the MADOCA product was first evaluated between different types of the GNSS constellation, such as GPS, GLONASS, and QZSS. Ionosphere-free combination was also applied to eliminate the ionospheric ranging errors. Furthermore, the vehicle experiment was conducted in Taiwan in a suburban environment to assess the performance of kinematic MADOCA PPP. Along with the root mean square error (RMSE), the average satellite number was compared among different types of constellations as mentioned above. However, standalone MADOCA PPP might pose severe problems because of environmental factors. Lane-level navigation was still difficult to achieve even with augmentation data aiding. Thus, kinematic MADOCA PPP was integrated with tactical-grade IMU by using tightly coupled scheme, which made the solution robust. Accurate velocity and attitude could thus be estimated. The result revealed that an INS-integrated MADOCA PPP could improve the performance in 3D and that lane-level positioning was achieved in a suburban area. All the algorithms proposed in this paper were processed in post-mission, but the application of the real-time satellite orbit and clock correction products enabled the analysis to approach a navigation solution in the real world.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of low-cost GNSS chips that allow multi-constellation, multi-frequency pseudorange, and carrier phase measurements has provided the hardware foundation for implementing precise point positioning (PPP) on smartphones. However, compared to professional geodetic receivers, smartphones suffer from severe multipath effects and signal quality loss, resulting in the convergence time for real-time PPP solutions becoming longer, from several minutes to a few hours, to converge to 1 m accuracy. By establishing high-precision atmospheric products (including ionospheric and tropospheric corrections), we aim to bring smartphone PPP to achieve instantaneous sub-meter positioning performance. For ionospheric Slant TEC (STEC) modeling, we employ the Satellite-based Ionospheric Model (SIM), and the average RMS of the model's accuracy is better than 2 TECU. The RealTime Tropospheric Grid Point (RTGP) model is based on the GPT2w model, and its accuracy is better than 1.2 cm on average. Both models are updated every 10 s to fulfill the requirements of real-time smartphone applications. Static experimental results in an open urban environment indicate that the Xiaomi Mi8 and Huawei P40 can converge to sub-meter levels within 6 s when utilizing a multiconstellation and dual-frequency PPP solution with precise atmospheric corrections. The positioning accuracy was obtained by Mi8 and P40 with a horizontal RMS of 0.36 m and 0.3 m. In the dynamic experiment with apparent occlusion, the horizontal convergence speed of the atmospheric augmentation PPP solution also showed satisfactory results, with both smartphones converging to 1 m within 5 s. Moreover, the RMS statistics of horizontal positioning accuracy of Mi8 and P40 reach 0.68 m and 0.54 m, respectively. The atmospheric augmentation PPP method presented in this paper effectively improves convergence time and positioning accuracy in the horizontal direction compared to the conventional PPP model and satisfies smartphone users' need for instantaneous sub-meter positioning in urban navigation.},

  abstract = {Among the existing BOC signal receiving technologies, the Dual dual binary phase-shift keying tracking tracking (DBT), originally designed for alternate BOC (AltBOC) modulated Galileo E5 signal and then extended to standard BOC signals, has its unique characteristics. It incorporates both single-band and dual-band processing schemes into a unified and simple structure to meet both requirements of improving ranging precision and anti-jamming. However, it is problematic to directly extend the DBT technique from the AltBOC signal to the standard BOC signal. The root cause of this problem lies in that there are some ripples on the cross-correlation functions (CCF) between the received standard BOC signal and the local replicas in the upper and lower sidebands. This leads to more complex thermal noise and antimultipath behaviors. So in this paper we propose an improved DBT method for standard BOC signals by adding two digital IF filters before tracking loops on the upper and lower sidebands, respectively. Simulated tests on the self-made software receiver demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of this new method.},

To improve the positioning accuracy of the indoor environment, an indoor positioning method based on Bootstrap filtering CSI ranging model is proposed. Firstly, the least square method is used to fit the ranging model based on effective CSI value. Secondly, Bootstrap Filter is used to smoothing the ranging error of the effective CSI measurement value, and decrease the influence of the process noise. Finally, using the triangulation method to estimate the coordinates of the target position. The positioning method is verified by experiments in a representative indoor environment and compared with two existing classical positioning methods in the same indoor environment.

  abstract = {The new generation of the satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS) has been initiated in Australia and New Zealand since 2017 and is anticipated to be a fully operational system by 2023. In addition to the traditional L1 service, the new SBAS also supports the dual-frequency multi-constellation (DFMC) service and the precise point positioning (PPP) service for GPS and Galileo dualfrequency users. Making use of the DFMC SBAS service, horizontal positioning accuracy at sub-meter to meter level can be realized in real-time depending on the measurement environment, which should benefit users of the intelligent transport system (ITS) in road transport. The integrity monitoring is essential for the ITS users to guarantee the reliability of the positioning service. During possible outage of the SBAS messages, the integrity monitoring of the DFMC SBAS positioning becomes difficult due to the missing corrections integrity information that should be updated regularly. Even when relieving these strict time-out windows for land-based applications, the increase of the horizontal protection levels (HPLs) with time is shown to be dramatic. In this contribution, a modified version of the advanced receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (ARAIM) algorithm is used during such SBAS outages. The HPLs are computed based on the ARAIM algorithm with different integrity parameters assumed to investigate their impact on the HPL. Under the expectation that higher precision of the satellite clocks and orbit corrections can be achieved for the new generations of the GPS and Galileo satellites in the future, the HPLs computed with the proposed modified ARAIM algorithm are shown to be close to the level of those based on the DFMC SBAS. In such a case, the ARAIM is expected to be a useful alternative approach for bridging the integrity monitoring of the non-safety-of-life ITS applications during the SBAS outages.},

Real-time, fast-convergence PPP can be implemented using free regional augmentation signals that broadcast correction messages for satellite orbit and clock bias. In this study, PPP was combined with Quasi-Zenith Satellite System multi-global navigation satellite system (GNSS) advanced orbit and clock augmentation (MADOCA). Furthermore, integrity monitoring was implemented for MADOCA-PPP in terrestrial applications. Localization integrity is an essential criterion for evaluating whether a navigation solution is trustworthy, and this criterion has been widely used in the GNSS. In this study, integrity monitoring was performed using an ionosphere-free combination of the GPS and GLONASS according to the corresponding MADOCA-corrected residuals. The residual characterization indicated that a Kalman filter-based chi-square test is suitable for conducting fault detection and exclusion. Simulated one or two satellite steps, and ramp faults can be appropriately excluded, which reveals the system’s capability for rejecting outliers from abnormal measurements. To construct the error bound for a certain integrity risk, the protection level, which has a Student’s t-distribution, was computed. The experimental results were validated in static and kinematic scenarios to assess the integrity and positioning performance of MADOCA-PPP.},

However, the traditional GM-PHD filter cannot form a continuous track in the tracking process, and it is easy to produce a large number of redundant invalid likelihood functions in a dense clutter environment, which reduces the computational efficiency and affects the update result of target probability hypothesis density, resulting in excessive tracking error. Therefore, based on the GM-PHD filter framework, the target state space is extended to a higher dimension. By adding a label set, each Gaussian component is assigned a label, and the label is merged in the pruning and merging step to increase the merging threshold to reduce the Gaussian component generated by dense clutter update, which reduces the computation in the next prediction and update. After pruning and merging, the Gaussian components are further clustered and optimized by threshold separation clustering, thus as to improve the tracking performance of the filter and finally realizing the accurate formation of multi-target tracks in a dense clutter environment. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can form a continuous and reliable track in dense clutter environment and has good tracking performance and computational efficiency.},

  abstract = {Signal-induced elevation-dependent (SIED) ranging biases have been observed with GPS SVN-49 and BDS-II signals. Several means and models of compensating this SIED bias have been proposed for standalone positioning, while for a satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS) exposed to an unexpected SIED anomalous signal, the wide-area differential (WAD) process will be invalid or even worsen and the conventional architecture of signal quality monitoring (SQM) might be confused to let the anomalous signal evade the detections. This paper clarifies the potential hazardous effects of induced to an SBAS by a SIED signal anomaly. Based on the ideas of some existing models in describing the SIED anomalies, a generic onboard-reflection threat model (GOR-TM) is derived for the design and evaluation of SQM algorithms of SBAS’s in addressing the potential SIED anomalies. Furthermore, a methodology of determining the practical threat space for a particular signal is also designed, including the initialization of threat space, the introduction of the concept of virtual equivalent reference station to account for the bias carried by the WAD corrections of an SBAS, the procedure of calculating the maximum differential pseudorange errors corresponding to the initialized threat space, and the reduction to obtain the practical threat space. GPS L1 C/A signal is utilized in simulations, and this proposed methodology is also applicable to other GNSS signals.},

However, its multi-peak autocorrelation function also poses new challenges for the GNSS receivers in terms of the designs of tracking loop and multipath mitigation techniques. A general wideband BOC signal tracking processing technology, namely Dual BPSK tracking technique, is employed to solve the problem of multi-peak autocorrelation function mentioned above. However, the multipath mitigation algorithm for DBT architecture is not specially considered yet. In this paper, we propose an offset correlator based multipath mitigation method for DBT technique of wideband BOC signals, which can effectively suppress multipath signals with low complexity. A software receiver demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of the new method. This method can also achieve the compromise between multipath and noise performance by adjusting the local pseudo-noise code phase for different application scenarios.},

  abstract = {Long term evolution (LTE) signals have the potential to be used for positioning, especially in challenging environments such as in urban area or indoors. Among a number of positioning techniques supported by LTE, the time-of-arrival (TOA)-based technique has attracted attention due to the achievable high positioning accuracy. However, if multipath propagation is present, the TOA measurements obtained with the conventional method may include large biases and cause significant positioning errors. To solve this, advanced TOA estimation algorithms are necessary for dealing with LTE signals. The first main purpose of this paper is to summarize several existing advanced TOA estimators, i.e., first peak detection (FPD) based on two different threshold criteria, information theoretic criteria (ITC), super-resolution algorithm (SRA), and delay-locked loop (DLL). The second main purpose is to evaluate the TOA estimation performances of these techniques with multipath propagation effects by simulations. With respect to the FPD, ITC, and SRA techniques, the probability distribution and statistical results of the TOA estimation errors are obtained for a wide range of signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) values and several types of realistic multipath propagation channels. The dependence of the estimation accuracy on the SNR condition, channel type, and key parameter setting is also analyzed for each technique. With respect to the DLL, the multipath error envelope metric is specifically evaluated considering different signal bandwidths to indicate the multipath mitigation performance. The narrow pull-in range limits the applicability of the DLL in dynamic environments. Finally, the quantitative root mean square (RMS) errors are compared for revealing suitable TOA estimation techniques in various situations. These techniques provide similar estimation accuracy for medium SNR values, but exhibit significantly different performances under relatively low or high SNR conditions. Moreover, some other performance characteristics of these techniques are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Cellular-based localization has emerged as an important means to provide independent positioning and navigation solutions or be integrated with other navigation sensors for enhancing urban and indoor positioning capability. Taking into account the low heights of both the cellular signal transmitters and receivers as well as the complex environments in urban and indoor areas, severe multipath propagation effect originating from the specular reflection and distributed diffuse scattering mostly occurs. This increases the difficulty in accurately extracting the delay and angle measurements for the received cellular multipath signals, with the aim of either combating or benefiting from the multipath effects. In general, path number estimation needs to be first performed, and followed by the multipath parameter estimation algorithms in the cellular positioning receivers. Information theoretic criteria (ITC), such as the classical minimum description length and Akaike information criterion, are commonly used as the path number estimators. However, due to the contribution of dense multipath component (DMC) from distributed diffuse scattering, the noise condition in the channel measurements might violate from the white noise characteristics and degrade the performance of ITC-based path number estimators. This paper first presents the tailored procedures of two kinds of ITC, originally developed for source enumeration in white and colored noise, for path number estimation in cellular positioning receivers. The performance of these ITC under multipath conditions in the absence or presence of DMC is comprehensively assessed by numerical simulations in terms of the probabilities of correct estimation, overestimation, and underestimation. The impact of the key design parameter in these ITCs and the DMC intensity on the path number estimation performance is also discussed. The statistical performance results clearly indicate their performance behavior under different multipath channel conditions, and motivate the necessity of designing more suitable path number estimators for cellular localization applications.},

With spoofing signals discriminated, a normal PVT solution can be recovered with authentic signals and then TOA measurements of spoofing signals can be captured from the smartphone and form a log file. We select a combination of smartphones with a minimum number of users and a maximum positioning accuracy. Each smartphone selected for spoofer localization uploads its logged data file to the server. Synchronization of observations and iterative least square (LS) algorithm will be carried out online to solve the position of the spoofer. Some difficulties and challenges, such as smartphones geometry and time synchronization are discussed in this paper. A fundamental field experiment is conducted to verify the feasibility of our proposed scheme.},

  abstract = {Various biases exist in the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data. If not corrected, they will significantly degrade the performance of GNSS applications. The GNSS carrier phase bias problem has received great attention since GNSS multifrequency signals are widely used. The GNSS carrier phase biases, their magnitudes and properties, the processing methods used within the receivers. GNSS signals usually have chip shapes due to the transmitting and receiving side of the signal processing chain in the front-end RF filter. Differences in the chip shaping distortions between GNSS satellites induce individual carrier phase biases which must be corrected for certain applications, such as positioning with mixed signals or PPP ambiguity resolution.This paper has analyzed the dependency of carrier phase biases on different correlator spacings for GPS L1 and L2 signals in a dual-frequency software receiver. Our results show that the carrier phase biases variations are different for living signals and simulated signals with correlator spacing. This discovery can help to understand carrier phase bias inside receivers and has the potential to improve the fractional cycle bias estimation model and accuracy.},

  abstract = {Using foot-mounted inertial sensor to track the trajectory is one of the main methods for indoor autonomous pedestrian navigation. However, due to its algorithm, inertial error accumulates over time. To solve this problem, the zero velocity update (ZUPT) takes the velocity error as the observation to amend other information of the carrier. Because zero velocity update can only observe the information of velocity and two horizontal angles, we cannot obtain the position information. In this paper, a dual-MIMU trajectory tracking based on support vector machine(SVM) constraint method is proposed. According to the motion of the human body, in the process of walking, the horizontal angular velocity is the greatest when the toes are off the ground. The theory of s SVM is used to collect the angular velocity of foot movement to classify the movements during the traveling process, Increase the number of observations, after observability analysis to improve positioning accuracy. According to the constraint of the largest step in walking, the inequality equation is constructed and a Kalman filter algorithm is designed. The average position error is 1.3\% after 5min’s walking. It verifies that this system has higher positioning accuracy.},

For onboard processing, the slope of the land surface is usually not considered or accurately modeled due to the computation limit, and this will cause mis-modeling of the SP location and errors in the code phase and Doppler frequency models for signal reflected off complex terrain, such as in the mountains. Discrepancies of up to 3 chips of GPS C/A code are shown in this paper for the code phase models from the processing results of CYGNSS raw data. The complex waveform/DDM processing presented in this paper can be configured for various ranges and spacings of the code phase and Doppler frequency shifts to allow various levels of model uncertainties. An example is presented for GPS signal reflected off the Himalaya region. The complex waveform processing result shows coherent reflection measurements that may not be captured by the normally applied open loop (OL) tracking approach, and the result also includes probable observations of glacier extent and surface variations.},

Due to the non-stationary nature of the carrier phase scintillations and the existence of non-scintillation related components in the carrier phase measurements, direct time domain or Fourier spectral correlation of the receiver array measurements cannot yield meaningful results. An adaptive periodagram is used to generate high-resolution time-frequency information for the scintillation signal carrier phase. The resulting timing varying spectra from the receiver array are filtered and cross-correlated to generate time delays of similar scintillation patterns across a two-dimensional array. Horizontal plasma drift velocities are estimated using the time delays, known receiver spatial separations, assumed GPS signal ionosphere piercing heights, and satellite scan velocities. Plasma drift velocities measured by the SuperDARN radar at Kodiak, Alaska are used to validate the estimation results from the GNSS receiver array.},

The higher number of LEO satellites and their much smaller footprints than those of the GNSS satellites motivate studies of the ground tracking network design to pursue higher visibilities to LEO satellites. This contribution proposes an algorithm, called here ‘MaxVis’ to select network stations for LEO satellites of different inclinations and altitudes. The goal is to increase the general visibility and shorten the visibility gaps of LEO satellite that can be observed from the entire ground network, i.e., when at least one of the network stations are visible to the satellite. A parameter can be set to balance the priority of the two objectives. It was found that LEO satellites with high altitudes and low inclinations tend to deliver high visibility. With only the polar regions excluded from the design area for demonstration purposes, the general visibility could reach above 98\% with less than 30 stations when the LEO satellite has an altitude of 1200 km and an inclination of 50 degrees. The visibility could be significantly reduced when island areas are excluded from the design area.},

During visual estimation, image features in consecutive frames are detected and matched to estimate the motion of the vehicle with a homography-based approach. Afterwards, the visual measurement is fused with the output of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) by an indirect extended Kalman filter (EKF). A delay-based approach for the measurement update is developed to introduce the visual measurement into the fusion without state augmentation. This method supposes that the estimated error state is stable and invariant during the second half of one visual calculation period. Simulation results indicate that delay-based navigation can reduce the computational complexity by about 20\% compared with general augmented Vision/INS (inertial navigation system) navigation, with almost the same estimate accuracy. Real experiments were also carried out to test the performance of the proposed navigation system by comparison with the augmented filter method and a referential GPS/INS navigation.},

  abstract = {The factor graph has become the standard framework for representing a plethora of robotic navigation problems. One primary reason for this adoption by the community is the fast and efficient inference that can be conducted over the graph when a unimodal Gaussian noise model is assumed. However, the unimodal Gaussian noise model assumption does not reflect reality in many situations, particularly measurements that may include gross outliers (e.g. feature tracking between images, place recognition, or GNSS multipath). To combat this issue, several methodologies have been proposed for conducting robust inference on factor graphs. These models work by reducing the contribution of constraints that do not adhere to the specified noise model by scaling the corresponding elements of the information matrix. A unifying assumption shared by the proposed robust graph inference algorithms is that the measurement noise model is known a priori and that the specified noise model does not vary with time. In the situation where the measurement model is not fully known, rejecting the outliers can become far more difficult. To overcome this issue, a novel method is proposed that utilizes a non-parametric soft clustering algorithm to iteratively estimate the measurement error covariance matrix. The estimated covariance mixture model is then used within the max-mixtures framework to mitigate the effect of false constraints. The proposed methodology provides robust optimization in the face of faulty measurements where little or no information is provided about the measurement uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Estimation techniques to precisely localize a kinematic platform with GNSS observables can be broadly partitioned into two categories: differential, or undifferenced. The differential techniques (e.g., real-time kinematic (RTK)) have several attractive properties, such as correlated error mitigation and fast convergence; however, to support a differential processing scheme, an infrastructure of reference stations within a proximity of the platform must be in place to construct observation corrections. This infrastructure requirement makes differential processing techniques infeasible in many locations. To mitigate the need for additional receivers within proximity of the platform, the precise point positioning (PPP) method utilizes accurate orbit and clock models to localize the platform. The autonomy of PPP from local reference stations make it an attractive processing scheme for several applications; however, a current disadvantage of PPP is the slow positioning convergence when compared to differential techniques. In this paper, we evaluate the convergence properties of PPP with an incremental graph optimization scheme (Incremental Smoothing and Mapping (iSAM2)), which allows for real-time filtering and smoothing.

Then, an example collected data set is utilized to validate the trends presented in the simulation study.},

  abstract = {The requirement to generate robust robotic platforms is a critical enabling step to allow such platforms to permeate safetycritical applications (i.e., the localization of autonomous platforms in urban environments). One of the primary components of such a robotic platform is the state estimation engine, which enables the platform to reason about itself and the environment based upon sensor readings. When such sensor readings are degraded traditional state estimation approaches are known to breakdown. To overcome this issue, several robust state estimation frameworks have been proposed. One such method is the batch covariance estimation (BCE) framework. The BCE approach enables robust state estimation by iteratively updating the measurement error uncertainty model through the fitting of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to the measurement residuals. This paper extends upon the BCE approach by arguing that the uncertainty estimation process should be augmented to include metadata (e.g., the signal strength of the associated GNSS observation). The modification of the uncertainty estimation process to an augmented data space is significant because it increases the likelihood of a unique partitioning in the measurement residual domain and thus provides the ability to more accurately characterize the measurement uncertainty model. The proposed batch covariance estimation over an augmented data-space (BCE-AD) is experimentally validated on collected data where it is shown that a significant increase in state estimation accuracy can be granted compared to previously proposed robust estimation techniques.},

The VDFLL enhances signal processing by taking advantage of spatial correlation between navigation satellites. The CVDFLL expands this advantage to spatial correlation between receivers of similar user dynamics. The algorithm relies on the pseudorange-state formulation of the VDFLL for collaborative processing as a means to keep the cooperative network federated. Additionally, this formulation is expected to be less sensitive to dissimilar dynamics between receivers. Monte-Carlo simulation and experimental results show that cooperative vector tracking can be very robust when employing several receivers. However, the analysis also suggests that the CVDFLL should be studied with a position-state formulation of the VDFLL due to its robust nature as well as the generally poor performance of the pseudorange-state filter.},

  abstract = {Originally designed for military navigation, GPS has exploded into a modern tool used by government, industrial, and commercial sectors. The increasing demand for navigation has led to the operation of GPS receivers in challenging signal environments that include suburbs, forested areas, and metropolitan cities. In recent years, GPS receivers have also come under attack from commercial jamming and spoofing devices. To assure the integrity of GPS, the ability for receivers to overcome challenging signal environments must be solved. GPS vectorized signal tracking (vector tracking) has been shown to enhance receiver performance by 2 to 6 dB in poor signal environments over traditional tracking methods that rely on loop filters (scalar tracking). GLONASS, the Russian Federation’s equivalent to GPS, is another system that can be used for navigation. Today, many receivers use both GPS and GLONASS with scalar processing. Implementing the constellations into a centralized vector tracking filter gives the opportunity of enhanced navigation capability in challenging areas. In this thesis, the development and analysis of a software receiver that uses GPS and GLONASS vector tracking is performed. Specifically, the software receiver uses a centralized Vector Delay/Frequency Lock Loop (VDFLL) Kalman filter implementation to track the code and carrier dynamics of the satellite signals. Cascaded Phase Lock Loop (PLL) aiding is applied to the satellite channels to maintain carrier phase lock. Simulation results showed the software receiver’s ability to maintain accurate navigation in GPS or GLONASS jamming environments. In GPS jamming environments, GLONASS was able to maintain accurate tracking replicas of the GPS channels through the VDFLL. Experimental results from forested areas and urban canyons showed that the software receiver performed better with vector tracking than scalar tracking. Depending on the experiment, GPS and GLONASS vector tracking outperformed GPS-only vector tracking. In some environments, GLONASS became degraded, which caused noise sharing issues in the software receiver’s vector processing algorithm.},

Here we revisit this assumption and show it is valid under specific circumstances: a purely rotating spacecraft and an ideal right-hand circularly polarized (RHCP) antenna with its boresight axis aligned to the spacecraft spin axis. A more general treatment of spacecraft motion and antenna modeling reveals both why phase wind-up is implicitly handled in these circumstances and how the algorithm might be modified to apply in other circumstances.},

  abstract = {Pose information is of great importance for control and navigation. For outdoor applications, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is a preferable choice because of its ability to supply global consistent positioning results. GNSS has been utilized in a mass of applications such as aviation and autonomous driving. On the other hand, a GNSS receiver is prone to interferences like multipath or spoofing attack. Therefore, a GNSS measurement should pass the authentication before incorporating into the pose estimation. Recently graph optimization based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) system that is tightly coupled with GNSS measurements has been developed to achieve a better positioning performance. However, little existing GNSS fault detection method can be directly adapted to such scheme. In this article we propose an innovation based GNSS fault detector. The proposed detector exploits the prior information derived from the marginalization process of the graph optimization, and can detect abnormalities such as drifts or jumps in GNSS positioning results. Moreover, the theoretically performance of the detector is evaluated in terms of the protection level, and several experiments over public datasets are conducted for performance validation.},

Based on these residuals integrity checks are performed both on all newly generated corrections before broadcasting as well as on already broadcast corrections received by the monitoring stations. In case out-of-tolerance corrections are detected, the corrections are flagged as not usable. In addition when the outof-tolerance correction is detected with already broadcast correction data a corresponding alarm flag is sent to the user within seconds. In addition to describing the overall integrity concept and the new integrity monitoring modules, the accuracy of the RTX Fast corrections is assessed and examples of real-life integrity events are discussed.},

  abstract = {Vehicle localization and navigation in a GPS-denied or GPS-degraded environment is a common use case in both civilian and military applications. Augmented reality (AR) applications in particular require a high level of localization accuracy to be perceptually convincing. In this paper we discuss our experimental results implementing a complete, working navigation system for vehicular AR, which is able to maintain high localization accuracy in situations where GPS loss occurs for significant periods of time. We have implemented a hybrid state filter that is able to considerably improve GPSdenied dead-reckoning solutions by merging the output of an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), or any off the shelf pose solution with our map-corrected particle filter. The solution is initialized with a known starting location and subsequently corrects the GPS-denied pose solution by performing a “roadaiding” correction using a distance-transform metric derived from an OpenStreetMaps (OSM) map. A calibrated camera provides RGB input to a semantic segmentation network that determines the location of the road. The geometry of the labelling helps the system decide whether the vehicle is on or off road and subsequently whether the map correction can be applied. Our experimental results show a marked improvement in overall accuracy under GPS-denied conditions over a purely deadreckoning INS solution on a truck mounted system on public roads. To demonstrate the robustness of our system, we drove for 112 minutes GPS-denied, achieving a median positional error of 5 meters and a median heading error of 28 mrad. This degree of accuracy supported consistent and perceptually convincing AR.},

  abstract = {Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning is an indispensable source of data for providing absolute positioning for autonomous driving vehicles (ADV). Satisfactory accuracy can be obtained in sparse areas. However, the performance of GNSS can be significantly degraded by signal reflections from buildings, causing multipath effects and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) receptions. State-of-the-art 3D mapping aided (3DMA) GNSS can significantly mitigate the effects of signal reflections caused by static buildings. However, this approach relies heavily on an initial guess of the GNSS receiver, and on the availability of 3D building models. Moreover, the NLOS reception caused by surrounding dynamic objects, such as double-decker buses, cannot be mitigated. To fill this gap, in this paper we propose a novel 3D LiDAR aided GNSS positioning method which makes use of an onboard 3D LiDAR sensor to detect and correct NLOS reception caused by both static buildings and dynamic objects. A novel sliding window map surrounding the ego-vehicle is first generated, based on real-time 3D point clouds from a 3D LiDAR sensor. Then, NLOS receptions are detected based on a real-time sliding window map using a proposed fast searching method. The proposed NLOS detection method does not rely on the initial guess of the GNSS receiver. Instead of directly excluding the detected NLOS satellites from further positioning estimation, the algorithm reported in this paper rectifies the pseudorange measurement model by (1) correcting the pseudorange measurements if the reflecting point of NLOS signals is detected inside the sliding window map, and (2) remodeling the uncertainty of the NLOS pseudorange measurement using a new weighting scheme. Finally, both the corrected and healthy pseudorange measurements are tightly integrated with an inertial navigation system (INS) using factor graph optimization (FGO). We evaluated the performance of the proposed method in two typical urban canyons in Hong Kong and found that improved accuracy is obtained even in such environments.},

To fill this gap, this paper proposed a novel method to exclude the potential GNSS NLOS receptions, aided by the local environment description generated with 3D LiDAR and inertial sensor, to further improve the GNSS-RTK. The local environment description, the 3D point cloud map, is built via LiDAR/inertial integration using factor graph optimization. Then the potential GNSS NLOS receptions are detected and remove using the 3D point cloud maps before the GNSS-RTK positioning. Finally, the improved GNSS-RTK positioning is adopted to correct the drift of the 3D point cloud map derived from LiDAR/inertial integration. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through a challenging dataset collected in urban canyons of Hong Kong using the automobilelevel low-cost GNSS receiver.},

  abstract = {Occurrence of autonomous driving introduces high requirement in GNSS positioning performance. GNSS is currently the only source providing absolute positioning information. It is indispensable for initial position estimation for the high definition mapbased localization solution in autonomous driving. Satisfactory positioning accuracy can be obtained in open space or sub-urban areas. However, its performance is heavily challenged in super-urbanized scenarios with the positioning error going up to even 100 meters, due to the well-known NLOS receptions which dominates the GNSS positioning errors. The recent state-of-art rangebased 3D map aided GNSS (3DMA GNSS) can mitigate most of the NLOS receptions. However, ray-tracing simulation is timeconsuming. Therefore, we present a novel method to detect the NLOS caused by surrounding buildings and correct the pseudorange measurements using 3D point clouds and building height without ray-tracing simulation. To estimate the geometry and pose of the building relative to GNSS receiver, a surface segmentation method is employed to detect the surrounding building walls. NLOS errors are estimated by integrating the geometry, pose relative to the GNSS receiver and satellites information. Finally, position estimation of GNSS receiver is implemented by weighted least square (WLS) based on the corrected and healthy pseudorange measurements. Dynamic experiment is conducted to evaluate the errors caused by the NLOS receptions and to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in a deep urbanized area, Hong Kong.},

A BOC signal is obtained by modulating the carrier with the pseudorandom noise (PRN) code chips and a rectangular square wave subcarrier. The autocorrelation function (ACF) of a BOC signal shows multiple peaks, while the envelope of the ACF is given by the triangle shaped correlation function of the PRN code. Therefore, the main peak of the ACF is sharper than the peak of the corresponding binary phase shift keying (BPSK) signal, which allows for a more accurate tracking, i.e. less tracking jitter, and an increased multipath robustness. On the other hand, there is a risk that a tracking loop locks to a secondary peak, which results in a systematic error in the pseudorange measurements if this is not detected and countered.},

  abstract = {Absolute positioning is an essential factor for the arrival of autonomous driving. Global Navigation Satellites System (GNSS) receiver provides absolute localization for it. GNSS solution can provide satisfactory positioning in open or sub-urban areas, however, its performance suffered in superurbanized area due to the phenomenon which are well-known as multipath effects and NLOS receptions. The effects dominate GNSS positioning performance in the area. The recent proposed 3D map aided (3DMA) GNSS can mitigate most of the multipath effects and NLOS receptions caused by buildings based on 3D city models. However, the same phenomenon caused by moving objects in urban area is currently not modelled in the 3D geographic information system (GIS). Moving objects with tall height, such as the double-decker bus, can also cause NLOS receptions because of the blockage of GNSS signals by surface of objects. Therefore, we present a novel method to exclude the NLOS receptions caused by double-decker bus in highly urbanized area, Hong Kong. To estimate the geometry dimension and orientation relative to GPS receiver, a Euclidean cluster algorithm and a classification method are used to detect the double-decker buses and calculate their relative locations. To increase the accuracy and reliability of the proposed NLOS exclusion method, an NLOS exclusion criterion is proposed to exclude the blocked satellites considering the elevation, signal noise ratio (SNR) and horizontal dilution of precision (HDOP). Finally, GNSS positioning is estimated by weighted least square (WLS) method using the remaining satellites after the NLOS exclusion. A static experiment was performed near a doubledecker bus stop in Hong Kong, which verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {The combination of the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and the inertial navigation system (INS) is extensively studied due to their complementariness. The recently investigated factor graph optimization (FGO)-based GNSS/INS integration positioning showed significantly improved performance in urban canyons, due to the global optimization property and the increased measurement redundancy of FGO, compared with the extended Kalman filtering (EKF) based method. However, only the GNSS pseudorange measurement was utilized in the existing FGObased GNSS/INS integration, and the potential of the Doppler frequency and carrier-phase measurements is still to be explored. To fill this gap, this paper proposed a tightly-coupled GNSS/INS integration via FGO by exploiting the potential of diverse raw GNSS measurements. Specifically, the GNSS pseudorange, Doppler frequency, and timedifferenced carrier-phase (TDCP) measurements are integrated with the INS via factor graph optimization. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified step-by-step using the challenging datasets collected using both automobile-level GNSS receivers in urban canyons of Hong Kong.},

Moreover, the urban canyon scenario introduces additional challenges to the existing FDE for integrity monitoring, causing missed or false alarms, due to the significantly increased percentage of fault measurements. This paper proposed a sliding window aided FDE for GNSS positioning based on factor graph optimization (FGO) to alleviate these key issues. Different from the existing snapshot-based and the sequential-based (e.g. Extended Kalman filter) integrity monitoring methods where only the current or two consecutive epochs of measurements are considered in the FDE process, the proposed method in this paper improves the measurement redundancy with the help of the sliding window structure. Meanwhile, the GNSS measurements inside the sliding window are considered multiple times which enables the reconsideration of fault measurements. Moreover, the FGO employs multiple iterations and re-linearizations which improves the initial guess of the state estimation for FDE. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through a challenging dataset collected in urban canyons of Hong Kong using automobile-level low-cost GNSS receivers.},

Conventionally, the two most common integration solutions are the loosely and the tightly coupled integrations using extended Kalman filter (EKF). Recently, the factor graph technique is adopted to integrate the GNSS/INS and improved performance is obtained compared with the EKF-based GNSS/INS integration. However, only simulated data are tested to show the effectiveness of factor graph-based method in the existing work. Moreover, the reason that why the factor graph-based integration obtains better performance is not presented in the existing reference. Therefore, this paper proposes to compare the performance of EKF, and the factor graph-based GNSS/INS integrations. Both loosely and tightly coupled integrations are comprehensively discussed. We test the four different GNSS/INS integration methods in typical urban scenario in Hong Kong. The performances of the four solutions are compared. The conclusion shows that the factor graph-based tightly coupled GNSS/INS integration obtains the best performance among the four methods. The detailed analysis of the reasons for the improvement caused by factor graph is also given in the paper from the angles of re-linearization and iteration.},

  abstract = {Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is vulnerable to spoofing attacks. For the purpose to shut down a spoofing attack eventually, spoofer localization is necessary before further appropriate action. A crucial step before spoofer localization is to detect and discriminate spoofing signals from authentic ones, which is the main intention of this paper. When several sensors are available for spoofer localization, we can utilize the spatial information to achieve our goal. Existing works usually require time synchronization in advance via cables between the sensors, which is inconvenient. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new method to detect and discriminate spoofing signals using multiple independent GNSS receivers, lifting the restriction of time synchronization in advance. This method makes use of common measurements provided by most commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) receivers, including code-based pseudorange and pseudorange rate. The principle and methodology of this method are explained in detail, and performance analysis is also given. At last, we carry out some field tests with Android smartphones to demonstrate the feasibility of this method.},

The platform also provides waferlevel-packaging of MEMS devices in cavities with different cavity pressures in a single bonding step. Single-chip timing and inertial measurement units (TIMU) are fabricated with high yield through the HARPSS+ platform, which features 3-axis highfrequency resonant gyroscopes with complete quadrature cancellation enabled by the slanted electrodes. High-bandwidth 3-axis accelerometers are used on the TIMU with high sensitivity provided by the nano-gaps. A high-Q BAW resonator is included as internal frequency reference for self-contained timing and inertial measurement, along with on-chip heaters for ovenization capability. Each device is packaged in cavities with different pressure levels ranging from atmosphere to sub-10Torr for optimized operation through one single bonding step. The nanogap-enabled high-frequency devices have high environmental robustness and small form-factor with the overall TIMU being 4.5mm⨯5.5mm⨯1mm. Fabricated TIMU demonstrates highperformance with sub-10°/h gyroscopes and sub-100μg accelerometers. Low power chip-level ovenization is achievable with on-chip heaters owing to small size and vacuum packaging.},

This is done by using digital map data together with data from an inertial navigation system (INS) aided by a GNSS receiver and a wheel tachometer. By comparing certain map features with estimates of these features provided by the INS, additional position estimates can be calculated. Within this framework different position estimates can be validated against each other, even if their positioning errors are partially correlated. The resulting safe position estimates can then be used for safe localisation on the railway network. We use data from two different quality INS installed on our measurement wagon to test our approach. The data recorded covers most of the Swiss normal gauge railway network. The results indicate, that the method allows the generation of validated reference points on most of the track lines, especially on regional lines with high variablity in the track features. Based on detailed digital map data a high accuracy and robustness of the reference points can be reached even in sections with low GNSS coverage.},

  abstract = {Navigation with terrestrial wireless infrastructure is appealing to overcome geometrical limitations of satellite navigation for users in environments with limited sky views. However, terrestrial signals are also prone to multipath that can result in angular and range estimates that are not representative of actual transmitter-receiver geometry. In this paper, some of these propagation effects are quantified for a particular urban non line-of-sight (NLOS) scenario, based on measurements of downlink reference symbols transmitted by a commercial Long Term Evolution (LTE) base station (eNodeB) and received by a massive antenna array mounted on a passenger vehicle. Empirical results indicate that large-scale statistics for a user making multiple passes through the same urban environment look similar when represented in terms of angles and delays despite changes in orientation and drive direction. Additionally, it is demonstrated that multipath effects can be utilized advantageously; it is possible to estimate not only user position but also orientation through wireless fingerprinting.},

  abstract = {The virtual array, an emerging antenna technology, is used in GNSS interference mitigation and the results are analyzed. This research extends the novel concept of a virtual array with adaptive inter-element spacing into GNSS interference rejection methods. A new way to integrate a virtual array into a GNSS application is explored and incorporated into Space-Time Adaptive Processing (STAP) algorithms. It is proposed that a virtual array with adaptive effective geometry can increase anti-jamming performance. To find a suitable geometry which yields better performance than the original, a genetic algorithm is used. The genetic algorithm, which is a method of nonlinear parameter optimization, is discussed in detail and explored as a suitable means of initializing the array. The case of adaptively steered element phase centers is compared to the standard case of uniformly spaced elements. For experimental validation, the simulation setup is as follows. Mutual coupling effects and phase center instability effects are ignored. A GNSS simulator is used to record signals from individual satellite signals and store them to separate files. Navigation signals and interference sources are replicated, phase shifted and combined to simulate 4-element Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (CRPA). The result is a 4-channel signal with the appropriate spatial phase differences on each component and channel. The combined signal is filtered using a conventional array configuration and STAP algorithm, and separately with the new adaptively spaced array configuration. The primary metric for comparing results is number of satellites acquired. The result is increased threat rejection without increased footprint or number of elements.},

The robot brings the antenna into 1440 different orientations without changing its coordinates, every orientation lasting for 1 second. The data is analyzed in a triple-difference approach. The estimated GPS L1 phase center corrections show a repeatability better than a millimeter (0.6 mm RMS).

However, this is not the case in real-life situations, for example, when GNSS is used for positioning in urban canyons. Furthermore, very little research has been conducted to evaluate the impacts of positioning accuracy on CAV applications at the traffic level. The objective of our paper is therefore to examine the effect of varying levels of positioning error on an example environmentally-friendly CAV application, Eco Approach and Departure at Signalized Intersections (EAD). Our findings indicate that the energy consumption and travel time of vehicles traversing a road network can be negatively impacted by inaccurate position estimation of the EAD-equipped vehicles. In particular, when the maximum position error exceeds 20 m, the travel time penalty may begin to outweigh the energy savings of the application, especially when congestion is present and all vehicles are equipped with the application.},

  abstract = {GPS has become a popular measurement choice for navigation solutions today because of it long term stability and worldwide availability. However, GPS is a low-power signal that can be easily blocked by large structures or jamming. Without GPS, many consumer-grade sensors are unable to provide accurate navigation solutions because of noise and bias errors. This paper presents a method for a GPS-free navigation solution by using a magnetometer-aided, radar/INS coupled filter for vehicle navigation. Previous work has been done on attitude-heading reference systems which use magnetometers and accelerometers to determine the attitude of a vehicle. This attitude measurement can be incorporated in to the measurement update of an EKF. The main contribution of this paper is a radar aided INS EKF that will propagate the INS solutions in the time update, while the measurement update will use the radar measurement Jacobian and the attitude measurement to correct the INS propagations errors. Results in simulation and with real-world data show that this filter is capable of estimating the position, velocity, and attitude of a vehicle by constraining the error associated with pure INS propagation. The radar used in this paper is a Delphi Electronically Scanning Radar, and provides measurements for range, range rate, and azimuth.},

  abstract = {In the attempt of improving the achievable performance and of extending the application domain of the legacy Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) concept, a technique extensively used in aviation to determine the integrity of GNSS position solutions, the EU-US Cooperation on Satellite Navigation Working Group C (WG-C) has developed a proposal for a RAIM evolution called Advanced RAIM (ARAIM). One of the first aims of the ARAIM concept is to enable the use of multiple GNSS constellations (and in particular the combination of GPS and Galileo) for both worldwide air navigation, that supports en-route and terminal-area flight, and lateral and vertical guidance during airport approach operations. In this context, the DARP project, carried out by a consortium led by Deimos Space SLU and co-funded by the EC/GSA, is developing a GNSS receiver prototype that integrates the ARAIM algorithm. The main objectives are to provide an ARAIM proof-of-concept based on the algorithm version proposed by the WG-C in the Algorithm Description Document (ADD) 3.1 [1], and to perform optimizations and improvements of this algorithm. The prototype is designed to be flexible enough to allow for changes in its configuration and internal components according to the evolution of the ARAIM definition and the project progress, providing in such a way valuable information for the consolidation of WG-C baseline ARAIM. This paper shows an overview of the current status of the project. The main architecture of the receiver and the ARAIM algorithm is shown. Then a summary of the test campaign and the instruments used for the simulation campaign is also described. Taking into account the current level of maturity of the ARAIM standards, the test campaign will focus mainly on validation of Horizontal ARAIM (H-ARAIM) mode concept within the real signal experimental campaign. In addition, the Vertical ARAIM (V-ARAIM) mode will be included in the test campaign based on simulated scenarios, with an overall lower depth of details.},

  abstract = {The utilization of hybridized INS/GNSS systems for space launcher applications presents big advantages with respect to the conventional navigators (as INS alone) used in such applications. However, for its integration it is necessary to cope with some challenging facts when using a GNSS receiver in a space launcher: the extreme dynamics as accelerations and jerks caused by the own launcher propulsion and the separation of the different stages, the environmental conditions caused by engines vibration, the rapidly changing environment caused by fast altitude increments, the launcher continuously rotating in roll and its effects on satellite visibility, the changing elevation angles, etcetera. In the frame of the project NAVIGA-VNE, SENER Aeroespacial (as project prime and Data Fusion design authority - DF), Deimos Space (as GNSS receiver design authority), and AVIO as the final integrator, are jointly working on the development of the Vega-C Navigation Equipment (VNE), an INS/GNSS navigation system aimed for the precise estimation of the PVT trajectory and attitude of AVIO’s VEGA-C space launcher. The objective of this paper is the description of the tools developed to support the VNE GNSS and Data Fusion and verification. It is overviewed the elements of the environment that have been modelled. Then a description of the GNSS performance model integrated in the Data Fusion Functional Engineering Simulator (DF-FES) tool is performed, focusing on the geometrical and signal propagation, the way the receiver logic has been simulated and the error models that have been included for the generation of the simulated GNSS raw observations. It is also explained how the GNSS model has been validated using a semi-analytical GNSS simulator that has also been developed in the frame of this project from tools already available at Deimos Space. After that, the integration of the performance model with other elements of the DF-FES is described; focusing on the iteration of the GNSS model with the integrated GNSS PVT estimator also developed by Deimos Space (also known as Navigation Processor or NAVPRO), which among other features integrates a velocity estimator based on Time Difference Carrier Phase (TDCP) algorithm. Finally, some relevant results of the GNSS performance model, with NAVPRO PVT output and DF PVT output will be included.},

  abstract = {The geometric placement of current GNSS has a common problem. When the skyplot is drawn in the northern hemisphere where most of the world’s population is distributed, an area without satellites exists in the north. The area is created due to the limitation of the inclination angle of navigation satellite orbit. The inclination angle of GPS, Galileo, and BeiDou is 55 – 56°. The area leads to an imbalance in satellite placement. Therefore, the DOP performance cannot be improved above a certain level. As a fundamental solution, a satellite needs to be arranged in the northern area where existing navigation satellites do not pass through. Satellites with large inclination angle and eccentricity of orbit such as the Molniya satellites are added at this time. The satellite is used as a new navigation satellite by slightly modifying the orbital parameter of the Molniya satellites. A newly designed high-inclination and high-eccentricity orbit satellite was applied to GPS for a simulation. DOP performance was improved to a greater extent than conventional GPS. The high-inclination and high-eccentricity orbit can also be applied to other GNSS. The GNSS with a new orbit will help users of GNSS of the northern hemisphere to obtain more accurate position results.},

Given their ubiquity, jamming mitigation and localization techniques are of crucial importance, for which jammer classification is of help. Datadriven models have been proven useful in detecting these threats, while their training using crowdsourced data still poses challenges when it comes to private data sharing. This article investigates the use of federated learning to train jamming signal classifiers locally on each device, with model updates aggregated and averaged at the central server. This allows for privacy-preserving training procedures that do not require centralized data storage or access to client local data. The used framework FedAvg is assessed on a dataset consisting of spectrogram images of simulated interfered GNSS signal. Six different jammer types are effectively classified with comparable results to a fully centralized solution that requires vast amounts of data communication and involves privacy-preserving concerns.},

Based on the nonlinear conjugate gradient method, this paper utilizes partially available distances and the absolute locations of a small number of pseudolites to estimate the absolute locations of other pseudolites accurately.

Due to the poor performance of the low-cost antenna and crystal oscillator of smartphone, the accuracy of traditional single point positioning can only reach about 10 meters. The target of this paper is to propose a pseudorange double difference (PDD) with IMU assisted model on smartphone. Real-time difference assisted by IMU positioning algorithm was first applied to realize high-precision positioning on stand-long smartphone platform. Three groups of pedestrian scenes positioning comparison experiments were carried out. The results show that MEMS-based IMU assisted PDD increases smartphone positioning precision and robustness, and the horizonal mean error can be less than 4 meters. It demonstrated that the algorithm can effectively stabilize the performance of smartphone positioning. The significance of this work is to prove that RTD assisted by IMU on low-cost mobile platform is feasible and this algorithm exhibits better performance than traditional positioning solutions.},

  abstract = {The concept of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) integrity refers to the measure of trust of the GNSS positioning solution, which is vital for safety-critical applications such as aviation and autonomous driving. While integrity monitoring was firstly introduced and widely applied in the GNSS aviation field, it is not suitable for GNSS positioning in urban scenarios due to unique circumstances such as limited satellite visibility, strong multipath and nonline-of-sight (NLOS) effects. For example, the direct exclusion of the GNSS multipath and NLOS would significantly degrade the geometry constraints, thus leading to highly conservative integrity monitoring (IM). As a result, the limited GNSS measurement redundancy and the inaccurate measurement uncertainty modeling in urban canyons will severely degrade the performance of both the GNSS positioning and integrity monitoring. To alleviate these issues, this paper proposed an integrity-constrained factor graph optimization (FGO) for GNSS positioning with the help of switchable constraints. Compared to the conventional GNSS IM methods which consider measurements in single epoch or two successive epochs, the proposed method improves the measurement redundancy by the factor graph structure. Meanwhile, the switch variable, which is introduced by switchable constraints and connected with each pseudorange measurement, can not only estimate the measurement uncertainties, but also satisfying the Chi-square testing of the conventional fault detection and exclusion (FDE) while maintaining satellite geometry. In particular, the calculated protection levels consider the effect of switch variables, hence bound the position error more accurately. The performance of this proposed method is evaluated on open-sky dataset with manually injected biases with gaussian random noise.},

To solve this issue, some scholars have proposed adaptive KF where the noise statistics are determined by the observation sequence real-timely. However, these algorithms are model-based methods, which means the accuracy of estimated noise statistics depends on system model. Inaccurate system model would undermine the performance of noise estimation algorithm, especially for backtracking. The computational errors, which are caused by improper reference frame, would be accumulated with the repeated iteration of FKF and BKF. To avoid the negative effects of inaccurate system model on noise estimation algorithm, a modified system model is proposed with respect to computational frame rather than ideal navigation frame. Simulation and experiments are utilized to illustrate the effectiveness of the modified algorithm.},

Due to the influence of network transmission and outliers of real-time corrections, the accuracy of user positioning is unreliable by using corrections from a single source. Thus, it is necessary to use the combination method to provide a more reliable and available corrections. In this contribution, we focus on an improved method regarding anomalous multi-system real-time satellite orbit and clock corrections. Firstly, since the orbit and clock corrections are self-consistent, a more general model for both orbit and clock combinations is proposed based on Square Root Information Filter (SRIF). Secondly, considering a proper clock model will enhance the accuracy of clock combination, one-order and two-order polynomial clock models are used for satellite clock combination. To validate the method, an experiment with 8 real-time satellite orbit and clock products is employed. Compared to all raw corrections, the combined corrections show the best performance for both stability and availability. Moreover, the accuracy of real-time PPP by using the combined corrections also validates the method proposed.},

  abstract = {The GPS L5 antenna phase center offsets (PCOs) for the BLOCK IIF satellites have been missing over the past decade, while the Galileo and BeiDou satellites’ multi-frequency PCOs have been officially released since the year of 2017. The underlying risks of duplicating the L1/L2 satellite antenna PCOs for the L5 signals, as usually conducted in most literatures for multi-frequency GPS precise point positioning (PPP), are underestimated or even unrealized by the GNSS community. However, recent studies have shown that incorrect third-frequency PCOs can significantly deteriorate the efficiency of multi-frequency PPP ambiguity resolution (PPPAR). Since traditional methods can only address ionosphere-free PCO estimation, we develop an approach to compute the L5 PCOs for the BLOCK IIF satellites using uncombined triple-frequency GPS observations with a second satellite clock estimated on L5 to mitigate time-variable inter-frequency satellite clock biases. One year (2019) of GPS data from about 135 globally distributed stations are used. Our L5 PCO estimates over the year manifest high temporal stability with standard deviations of about 3 mm in the x and y components and about 20 mm in the z component. Of particular note, the differences between the L1/L2 satellite PCOs and our L5 PCO estimates can reach a maximum of 91 mm for the z component. We further used 31 days of GPS data from 21 IGS stations in 2020 to evaluate our L5 PCO estimates. It is shown that the convergence times of triple-frequency PPP-AR in the case of our L5 PCO estimates are shortened on average by 15\% compared to those based on the duplication of L1/L2 PCOs for the L5 signals. We also carried out a vehicle-borne GPS experiment where triple-frequency PPP-AR using our L5 PCO estimates achieved 18\% faster convergences than those using the L1/L2 PCO duplications for the L5 signals. We demonstrate that it is critical to use accurate satellite antenna PCOs, especially for the third-frequency signals, to maximize the convergence advantages of multi-frequency PPPAR over its dual-frequency counterpart.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel line-of-sight (LOS) signal identification scheme and a corresponding radio localization algorithm for receivers in future cellular networks. The novelty of our algorithm is that the Doppler component of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals is retained for navigation, while the ranging component of NLOS signals is discarded. The proposed scheme is based on a Kalman filter that integrates range, bearing, and Doppler measurements acquired from both LOS and NLOS signals. The Kalman filter uses both LOS and NLOS signals for the prediction step while excluding NLOS signals from the correction step with the help of a residual test. In the correction step, the receiver only updates its position if one of the received signals is classified with confidence to be an LOS signal. If no LOS signal is detected with confidence, position is simply propagated via dead reckoning using velocity estimates from Doppler. In this paper, we also evaluate the system’s continuity and integrity to characterize the performance of the residual test for safety-of-life applications such as automated driving.},

  abstract = {Multi-band collaboration (MBC) is a growing trend for code delay tracking in urban environments, in which signal blockage and multipath are major challenges that prevent robust and precise GNSS signal tracking. MBC exploits common variables associated with signals transmitted from the same satellite, such as propagation path, to mitigate multipath interference. To combine multiband signals in the code delay tracking loop, the code delay misalignment among signals requires either compensation using an ionosphere model or simultaneous tracking of all code delays. The former can only obtain the pseudorange of one band, while the latter is usually entailed by a complex system model. This work proposes a new scheme for the MBC-based code delay tracking loop, which consists of one outer loop and multiple inner loops for each signal. The outer loop tracks the code delay of the reference signal, while the inner loops track each signal’s code delay misalignment from the reference signal and provide multipath detection based on the correlation values. The MBC-based code tracking performance will be compared with standalone tracking and verified in both Monte Carlo simulation and real data collected in urban environments.},

  abstract = {Compare with outdoor positioning, indoor positioning has been overlooked by many investigators. While GNSS can be made to work indoors, the lower signal levels and poor multipath environment mean that performance is much worse than outdoors, and in some places there is no coverage at all. Indoor GNSS and cell-phone bearer positioning will be in general use for emergency calls from mobiles (E911/E112), but with an accuracy close to 100 m (which is sufficient for this particular service). In contrast to the GPS, the DTV signals are received from transmitters at relatively short distance, while the broadcast transmitters operate at levels up to the megawatts effective radiated power (ERP). Also the RF frequency of the DTV signal is much lower than the GPS, which makes it easier for the signal to penetrate buildings and other objects. So it is suitable for the precision positioning inside the building and the city center. The digital television terrestrial broadcasting (DTMB) is one of important standard about DTV, which is regulated by the national standard GB2006-20600. DTMB transmission system using time domain synchronous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (TDS innovation OFDM) of single and multicarrier modulation. This modulation mainly for broadband transmission channel characteristics of terrestrial digital multimedia television broadcasting can achieve good performance in linear time-varying transmitter channel or frequency selective and time selective exist at the same time channel. Pseudorandom sequence (PN) is introduced in DTMB signal frame header, DTMB signal has more stronger correlation than other DTV standards. So DTMB is more suitable for precise indoor positioning.},

  abstract = {Localization plays a vital role in various autonomous systems, providing essential information for perception and planning tasks. However, mainstream localization methods are based on the sensors approach, which is vulnerable in some extreme conditions where sensors probably fail in a short period, such as the camera-based visual positioning. This study proposes a sensor-free localization method by integrating vehicle dynamic models and an online system identification module. First, a system identification process is conducted online to identify the system dynamics of the powertrain system and the steering system of the autonomous vehicle. Then, the identified system responses are taken as the control input of the vehicle dynamic model to produce the positioning results. The simulated experiments show that the proposed method achieves better positioning performance than the conventional vehicle dynamic models. In addition, the extendibility of the proposed method is explored by fusing it with extra sensors based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Furthermore, the navigation ability of the proposed method without sensors is also examined along a trajectory of 140 meters. The proposed method successfully accomplishes the navigation task without any collisions, demonstrating the effectiveness in enhancing the security of autonomous systems with navigation needs when sensors fail in extreme conditions.},

When the spoofing signal is on top of the authentic signal, their summation moves the code and carrier error discriminators in a way similar to multipath except that one is location-dependent (multipath) while the other is persistent (spoofing).},

The radio interfaces and signal standards reveal similarities but also important differences between them, which affect navigation and positioning performance. To better understand the benefits and drawbacks for a SOOP-based navigation system, we will present performance comparisons both analytically based on signal standards and experimentally using real data. Analytically, we will compare the channel structure, chip rate, frame length, coherent integration time, spreading power, base station synchronization, and tracking performance, among others. Experimentally, we use a mobile testbed built from commercial off the shelf (COTS) components to validate our analytical results. The testbed consists of a multi-channel software-defined radio and associated software receivers. Results related to tracking robustness and stability of these three types of signals of opportunity under mobile situations in different environments have demonstrated that a combined solution of DTV+CDMA is recommended.},

The objective is to understand the ionosphere irregularity geolocation uncertainty in the RO observations. Two intense geomagnetic storms commenced on 20 and 31 December 2015 are used in this study. Three aspects of research are conducted. First, time lags between the RO scintillations and the ISM observations of the same irregularity events during the storms are characterized. Then, according to the time lags and ionospheric irregularity drift velocities inferred from the ground-based ISM receivers, the RO irregularity locations are adjusted. Finally, the new locations of the RO irregularity are compared with the RO signal tangent points to evaluate their geolocation uncertainty. Our results indicate the RO scintillation observations in the vicinity of the ground-based GNSS area are closely correlated with the scintillation indices generated by the ISM receivers within a time window ranging from a few minutes to 2.5 hours. The distance between the RO tangent points and the irregularity front inferred from ground observations suggests the uncertainty in the geolocation of the RO observations is in the range of several hundred to 7000 km (in both X and Y coordinates). Future study is needed to verify the results above.},

In the multi-frequency tracking design, a virtual fundamental carrier with longer wavelength was firstly constructed to associate multi-carriers according to the frequency diversity and dependency. The multi-carrier measurements are combined to perform inter-frequency aiding on the Doppler and Doppler rate estimations for each frequency channel, while each carrier phase will be tracked independently with consideration of phase divergence. Based on the realistic carrier phase estimation and fundamental geometric Doppler component, the geometry-free carrier phase can be obtained and used for high rate/high-resolution cycle-slip detection and correction in the signal tracking level. We use the simulated raw data to verify the proposed algorithm. The results confirm that the accuracy and robustness of the multi-frequency tracking can be guaranteed during the strong ionosphere scintillation. In addition, the small scale and fast cycle slips on each carrier can also be detected and repaired.},

This algorithm is achieved by adaptively switching between the singlefrequency tracking (ST) mode and the joint-frequency tracking (JT) mode according to the signal carrier to noise ratio (C/N0) estimates. The ST mode only considers measurements from a single carrier. In the JT mode, states for multiple carriers are modeled and estimated based on measurements obtained utilizing the inter-frequency Doppler relationships among the carriers. The real multifrequency GPS data collected on Hawaii Island with strong tropospheric and ocean surface multipath scintillations were firstly characterized and analyzed and then used to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. Tracking results demonstrate that the improved AMF algorithm can improve tracking accuracy over conventional tracking methods in the presence of nonconcurrent frequency selective fading during strong scintillations.},

It is observed that the storm-related plasma irregularities occurred related to the auroral energy deposition over the polar ionosphere, which cause the large degradation of PPP solutions at high latitudes.

  abstract = {Positioning with signals of opportunity (SOOP) encounters two major technical challenges in urban mobile environments, namely, multipath and clock errors. The presence of signal fading, multipath dominance over direct signal, and non-line of sight (NLOS) signal can occur more than 50\% of the time, as evident in the experimental data presented in this paper. As such, conventional delay lock loop (DLL) based on correlation peak tracking can be easily destabilized. As a remedy, we set forth a first arrival estimation method based on the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection and matching pursuit (MP) algorithm, which is shown to provide better pseudorange measurements. Furthermore, not all commercial signals of opportunity strictly align their clock to a stable frequency reference such as the GPS atomic time but rather may apply local frequency adjustment on their own. Such an adjustment may result in higher order oscillatory clock errors. We propose to use a six-state Kalman filter to calibrate both quadratic and sinusoidal error terms so as to prevent long-term pseudorange divergence and error growth in the position solutions. Finally, we present experimental data illustrating standalone and inertial-integrated position solutions to demonstrate the performance of urban mobile positioning with mixed signals of opportunity (digital television and cellular phone signals).},

The performance of the PHD filter, however, is sensitive to the available knowledge on model parameters such as the measurement noise variance and those associated with the changes in the maneuvering target trajectories. If these parameters are unknown in advance, the tracking performance may degrade greatly. To address this aspect, this paper proposes to incorporate the adaptive parameter estimation (APE) method in the PHD filter so that the model parameters, which may be static and/or time-varying, can be estimated jointly with target states. The resulting APE-PHD algorithm is implemented using the particle filter (PF), which leads to the PF-APE-PHD filter. Simulations show that the newly proposed algorithm can correctly identify the unknown measurement noise variances, and it is capable of tracking multiple maneuvering targets with abrupt changing parameters in a more robust manner, compared to the multi-model approaches.},

Since 2016, smartphone with the Android operating system can output raw GNSS pseudorange and carrier phase measurements, allowing researchers to improve smartphone navigation capabilities. The realm of sensor fusion is also being explored using smartphone’s sensors, including inertial measurement units (IMUs), cameras and other fusion techniques. The research presented in this research only deploys IMU and GNSS sensors native to existing smartphones and achieves a stand-alone solution using PPP/IMU integration that outperformed standard techniques. In open-sky vehicle experiments, the dual-frequency PPP/IMU sensor integration algorithm is able to achieve 1.6 m horizontal rms, reducing 80\% of horizontal errors in GNSS-challenging environments through a tightly-coupled smartphone GNSS-PPP integrated solution that is yet to appear in any publications.},

  abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals are susceptible to spoofing attacks, because of their open structure and weak power. Inertial navigation system (INS) is not affected by electromagnetic interference, which provides the INS/GNSS integrated system anti-spoofing capability. Innovation represents the difference between the pseudorange calculated by standalone GNSS and the priori estimate of pseudorange generated by the Kalman Filter. It can be employed to detect spoofing attacks. Various innovation-based spoofing detectors have been developed. However, in actual applications, it is found that the maneuver of user equipment (UE), such as a sudden turn or sudden acceleration, can also trigger the threshold of an innovation-based spoofing test statistic, leading to a very large probability of false alarm (Pfa). In this work, we address the problem of high false alarm rate due to UE maneuver by developing a specific force-aid spoofing detection algorithm. It employs the fact that the specific force will not be affected by spoofing, but will be affected by UE maneuvering. A new metric is developed, which is defined as the ratio of the sum of squares of normalized innovations and the sum of squares of specific force in horizontal directions. We evaluated the performance by both simulations and a hardware-based experiment. A dynamic driving test was carried out in Hainan, China. Results show that the proposed method significantly suppresses the high-PFA due to UE maneuver and meanwhile provides a slightly better spoofing detection performance than the conventional innovation-based method.},

A self-contained implementation that cascades pre-correlation nullsteering and post-correlation angular estimation and beamforming is set forth in this paper. The proposed method suppresses jamming by projecting the array outputs onto the jamming nullspace, thus preserving the spatial information for subsequent processing. In the jamming nullspace, the baseband signal processor adopts a master-slave architecture where the same code and carrier replicas drive all channels to maintain phase coherency. Spatial combining, non-coherent in acquisition and coherent in tracking, is used for three intertwined code, carrier, and angular tracking loops. Post-correlation angular estimation can be further used for attitude determination. Test results under realistic jamming conditions are presented that demonstrate the system functionality and performance.},

While the hydrostatic tropospheric delay can be well estimated to an accuracy of better than 5 mm (if surface pressure measurements are provided), the nonhydrostatic (or wet) delay is hard to model accurately due to the rapid spatial and temporal variation of the water vapour. In the traditional Slant Tropospheric Delay (STD) estimation methods, Zenith Tropospheric Delay (ZTD) is estimated first, then it is mapped on to individual satellite to receiver path. However both ZTD estimation and the mapping function have limited accuracy, especially when real time atmospheric profile information is not available. Besides, the mapping of the single zenith delay implies that the local atmosphere profile is symmetric around the receiver site, which does not valid in the event of weather front passing. In some severe cases, the azimuth dependent residue left on each STD will significantly deteriorate the PPP performance, in terms of both convergence time and height accuracy.},

Our preliminary results indicate that there is a total of 1\textasciitilde 14 hours of time lags between the observed sudden change in solar wind parameters and detection of the ground-based scintillation. This time lag consists of two components. The first component is due to the time takes for the solar wind to yield the SSC which is about 30\textasciitilde 80 minutes. The second component is the time takes for the SSC to cause ionospheric disturbances which lead to scintillation. It is about 30 minutes to 13 hours. In addition, a longer time lag was mostly observed when the ISM receiver was on the dayside at the onset time of the geomagnetic storms. These findings will provide a new insight into the lead time in scintillation forecast in space weather.},

However, when there is no external auxiliary information, the inertial navigation error based on low-cost MEMS IMU will quickly accumulate over time. Reducing inertial navigation error has great potential in many applications. Conventional ground vehicles are restricted by Non-Holonomic Constraint (NHC), during the outage of GPS. Although the navigation performance of the inertial system with only NHC as the motion constraint is improved, the observability of the system is still poor due to the lack of forward speed constraint. According to MEMS IMU, an innovative method is proposed to improve the observability of the inertial navigation system through continuous rotation of a single MEMS IMU around a certain axis, during the outage of GPS. In this paper, although the azimuth error is still unobservable, both theoretical analysis and the results indicate that the system observability is improved by rotating IMU. The enhanced estimability of the gyro bias in the vertical direction can effectively mitigate the azimuth error accumulation.},

To accomplish this purpose, we define a survival model and introduce probability of confirm for each Gaussian component and each track which are adaptively calculated in time.

The radar of Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) in Taiwan not only provides track information of aircrafts but also output weather data that is especially crucial for aviation safety during dangerous meteorological phenomena. For the past fifteen years, the TRAC2100/MSSR radar in Magong airport and the ASR-9/MSSR radar in Kaohsiung national airport played a significant role in supporting the terminal air traffic management for air space over west Taiwan. But the occurrence of instability and performance degradation have lead Taiwan CAA to the decision to update the current radar equipment. In order to fully exploit the updated radar equipment and maintain aviation safety, commensurate revision on the corresponding software is required.},

This research explores difficult swarm Guidance Navigation and Control (GNC) scenarios using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). DRL polices are trained to provide guidance inputs to agents in multi-agent swarm environments for completing complex, teamwork focused objectives in geosynchronous orbit. An example scenario is explored for a group of satellite agents moving to triangulate an object in a relative orbit space that potentially maneuvers. Reward shaping is used to encourage learning guidance that positions swarm members to maximize cooperative triangulation accuracy, using angles-only sensor information for navigation relative to the target. Results show the policies successfully learn guidance through reward shaping to improve triangulation accuracy by a significant factor.},

In order to analyze the performance of BDS-3 precise point positioning (PPP), RTKLIB open source program package based on the Visual Studio 2017 compilation platform is transplanted and re-developed, and the stations with the BDS-3 signal receiving capability is selected from the Multi-GNSS experiment (MGEX), in order to compare PPP performance of BDS-3/GPS, BDS-3/GLONASS, and BDS-3/Galileo integrated systems. The experimental contents included static PPP, pseudo-dynamic PPP, number of visible satellites and DOP value. The experimental results show that BDS-3/GPS integrated system has the largest number of visible satellites and the smallest Dilution of Precision value. The accuracy of three directions N, E, U (North, East, Up) after static PPP convergence is better than 5cm; PPP positioning jitter of BDS3/GLONASS and BDS-3/Galileo integrated system after convergence is larger than the BDS-3/GPS integrated system, and the convergence time is longer than BDS-3/GPS integrated system. Whether it is static or kinematic, BDS-3/GPS has the best positioning performance. It would provide a reference for the better scientific research and engineering applications of Beidou-3.},

The system is designed for micro aerial vehicles, but can be applied generally for low-cost, lightweight, high-accuracy, geo-referenced pose estimation. Visual and inertial measurements enable robust operation despite GNSS degradation by constraining uncertainty in the dynamics propagation, which improves fixed-integer CDGNSS availability and reliability in areas with limited sky visibility. No prior work has demonstrated an increased CDGNSS integer fixing rate when incorporating visual measurements with smartphone-grade inertial sensing. A central pose estimation filter receives measurements from separate CDGNSS position and attitude estimators, visual feature measurements based on the ROVIO measurement model, and inertial measurements. The filter’s pose estimates are fed back as a prior for CDGNSS integer fixing. A performance analysis under both simulated and real-world GNSS degradation shows that visual measurements greatly increase the availability and accuracy of low-cost inertial-aided CDGNSS pose estimation.},

  abstract = {Indoor location estimation is an important subject of research because it is useful for rescue assistance in times of disaster and for commercial applications in peacetime, like robot navigation in buildings. It accompanies difficulties to simulate the propagation of radio waves inside an elevator precisely, which has a narrow slit-like gap and an enclosure structure stacked with multiple metal plates. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify this by actual measurement. In this paper, I report the results of measuring RSSI in a consequently electromagnetically shielded environment, such as inside an elevator, and investigating the feasibility of its location estimation from RSSI inside the elevator enclosure. I measured the RSSI of an elevator with its doors closed and compared it to the RSSI outside the elevator to determine if it is possible to estimate the location of the elevator enclosure. The target of this RSSI measurement is a reinforced concrete building with seven stories above ground and two below, and the total number of WLAN base stations is 101, using 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands. First, all BSSID, frequency band, RSSI were measured with a smart phone at all 101 base station locations. Then, I measured the RSSIs at inside of the elevator (with the doors closed) and outside the elevator, respectively. To ease the utilization of the RSSI fingerprint, I proposed the RSFI (Received signal strength indicator Fingerprint Similarity Index). The measurement results showed that the RSFI in the elevator on different floors are clearly different, indicating that position estimation is possible enough. Furthermore, RSFI was also found to indicates the differences in position within the elevator cabin. It is not difficult to use this RSFI, and I believe that it would be useful for the development of ILBS (Indoor Location Based Service) at the user level.},

  abstract = {This study focuses on spatial decorrelation of ionospheric delay observed with a baseline length of several kilometers. In particular, we aim to observe spatial and temporal variations of the mid-latitude nighttime medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs) with a small horizontal scale of several kilometers. To extract small perturbation of ionospheric delay difference with a short baseline, we use a multi-RF-port GNSS receiver together with Radio-over-Fiber (RoF) devices. Using them, we built an observational system to use a common clock for signal processing of RF inputs from two GNSS antennas with a separation of 2.3 km. Through geometrical correction process using GNSS satellite orbit information and a set of the pre-analyzed GNSS antenna positions, common-satellite single differences in carrier phase measurements based on single frequency of L1 signals represent atmospheric delay differences between the two GNSS antennas without necessity to consider or estimate a component of receiver clock errors. As the first step of analysis, we examined the single differences of SBAS (Satellite-Based Augmentation System) ranging signals. Because SBAS is geo-stationary satellite, a time series of its ranging signal contains temporal variations of atmospheric delay along the “stationary” path. We carefully extracted and confirmed ionospheric delay differences with distinction from tropospheric delay. As results, the variations with large spatial gradients up to ±54 mm/km in slant direction were found in the observational data nighttime on 26th May, 2016. The results are larger than the typical value for overall structure of the mid-latitude nighttime MSTIDs. There are two possibilities to explain the results. The first is the observational results might be resulted from disturbances in the E region. Another possibility is that the results also represent structure of disturbances including in the F region. Although it is necessary to increase a number of analysis for the similar events, the result suggests that there are smaller scale structures in the mid-latitude nighttime MSTIDs than the scale of the overall structure. It is also necessary to reconsider its impact on navigation systems and positioning applications.},

  abstract = {In the GNSS/INS integrated navigation system, the filtering accuracy of Square-root Cubature Kalman Filter (SCKF) will reduce when the measurement noise statistics is not precisely known. To solve this problem, a Modified Adaptive SCKF (MASCKF) method is proposed. At first, the maximum likelihood estimation of the innovation covariance with a moving window is calculated to adaptively adjust the measurement noise statistics. Then, a new adaptive filter framework is designed, which utilizes a plurality of moving window estimators with different widths. Finally, the corresponding weights are set according to the different innovation covariance, which can optimize the innovation covariance and reduce the filtering errors due to the improperly selected width of moving window. To evaluate the performance of this algorithm in the GNSS/INS integrated navigation system, a vehicle test is conducted. The test results show that the proposed MASCKF can improve the estimation accuracy and robustness compared to SCKF and ASCKF. The proposed method can effectively improve the adaptive ability and performance of the GNSS/INS integrated navigation system.},

For each of the eight satellites whose elevation angles are greater than 20deg, a sequence of 100 wind speed estimates were produced. The results show that the root mean square error of the eight error sequences ranges from 0.3m/s to 0.94m/s.

Considering the limited space, power, and size of small UAVs, the proposed approach does not require any sensors on the UAV. The typical repeated dynamic patterns of such UAVs are related to the actuators to offer a useful information for estimating the UAV navigation states. Machine learning (ML) classifier has been employed to detect these repeated dynamic patterns, then according to the detected pattern, an appropriate constraint/update is utilized to enhance the navigation solution through EKF to obtain a better estimate of the UAV states. Different test scenarios where conducted to verify the ability of the proposed approach to aid the INS solution during GNSS signal outages. The solution after fusing the Vheicle Model (VM) is enhaced by 98\% compared to low cost stand-alone IMU solution.},

  abstract = {The goal of this contribution is to assess the impact statistical model selection has on confidence levels of parameter estimators in linear(ized) GNSS models. In the processing of observational data, parameter estimation and statistical testing are often combined. A testing procedure is exercised to select the most likely observational model among the hypothesized ones, which is then followed by the estimation of the identified model parameters. The resulting estimator will inherit the uncertainties involved in both estimation and testing which need to be properly taken into account when computing the corresponding confidence level. The approach that is usually followed in practice to determine the confidence level is to compute the probability of the estimator lying in a region around its true value conditioned on the identified hypothesis. Therefore, use is made of the estimator’s distribution under the identified hypothesis without regard to the conditioning process that led to the decision of accepting this hypothesis. In this contribution, it will be shown that for a proper computation of the confidence level in combined estimation-testing procedures, the associated probability should be conditioned not only on the identified hypothesis, but also on the testing outcome that led to the decision of accepting this hypothesis. Therefore, use need to be made of the conditional distribution of the estimator. We will provide numerical analysis of confidence levels with and without accounting for conditioning on testing decision using a number of examples in the context of GNSS single point positioning. It will be demonstrated that the customary practice which makes use of unconditional distributions to evaluate the confidence level, may give a too optimistic description of the estimator’s quality.},

  abstract = {The use of low-cost and ultra-low-cost receivers has been drastically increasing due to their low cost compared to the high-end geodetic receivers. Early smartphones only provided single-frequency GNSS observations. However, dual-frequency GNSS smartphone has been launched in recent years which enables the user to make ionospheric-free (IF) linear combinations between observations of two frequencies to eliminate the first-order ionospheric delay. Such an IF combination would increase the noise level of observations. To overcome the problem of large noise of traditional IF pseudorange combination, the University of Calgary (UofC) model can be employed. It employs the IF linear combinations of carrier-phase and the two averages of the pseudorange and carrier-phase observations on the same frequency. In the case of dual-frequency smartphones, there are limited number of satellites which could transmit navigation signals at both frequencies (L1 and L5 for GPS and E1 and E5a for Galileo) which makes the position determination difficult or even impossible using only dual-frequency observations. The solution to make use of all GNSS measurements is to employ a model consisting of both dual-frequency UofC model and the single-frequency (SF) ionosphere-corrected code and phase measurements of the remaining satellites. In addition to the functional model, the stochastic model plays an important role in GNSS positioning. The least-square variance component estimation (LS-VCE) method is applied to the double-difference (DD) code observations of two Xiaomi Mi 8 devices to obtain suitable variances for GPS, GLONASS and Galileo. The performance of the UofC model combined with the SF ionosphere-corrected model is investigated in both static and kinematic modes, while introducing a more reliable stochastic model in smartphone positioning. The results confirmed that introducing a more reliable stochastic model would improve the PPP performance in both static and kinematic modes. In the static test, an improvement of 8.3\% and 17.9\% was achieved on the root mean square (RMS) of horizontal positioning error and its 50th percentile error, respectively. Using our kinematic dataset and the data provided by Google, an approximate improvement of about 20\% on the RMS of horizontal positioning error and its 50th percentile error was also observed while employing a more reliable stochastic model.},

  abstract = {The availability of GNSS carrier-phase measurements from smartphones and tablets has made accurate positioning possible with smartphones. However, it requires the development of advanced positioning algorithms to process the GNSS measurements from smartphones. In this research, we propose the use of time-differenced carrier-phase (TDCP) observations, instead of raw Doppler observations to improve precise point positioning (PPP) and real-time kinematic (RTK) performance with smartphones. Although the GNSS Doppler observations can contribute to the velocity estimation of a moving object and subsequently the positioning solutions, the current Doppler observations from the Android smartphones are found biased with respect to the carrierphase observations. This would affect the positioning performance in PPP and RTK. Our research results demonstrate that a positioning algorithm introducing velocity vector estimates from time-differenced carrier-phase observations as weighted constraints along with the GNSS pseudorange and carrier-phase observations can improve the positioning performance of both PPP and RTK with smartphones. Implemented into a constrained Kalman Filter for both PPP and RTK methods, the positioning models along with mathematical equations and their positioning performance have be assessed using the training datasets from the "Google Smartphone Decimeter Challenge, 2021 and 2022". An improvement on the RMS of horizontal positioning is achieved when employing the TDCP observations in both kinematic tests. A significant improvement in 50th percentile error, the maximum absolute of the horizontal error and the positioning performance in the beginning epochs is also confirmed using the proposed method.},

  abstract = {This paper concerns the problem of multipath detection in global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning. An unsupervised machine learning (ML) approach is developed using a convolutional neural network in an autoencoder framework with k-means clustering in the latent space. Such methods often rely on large amounts of annotated data during training, which are difficult to collect in the context of GNSS applications. To this end, a joint approach is proposed to train the ML method on synthetic data generated by hardware in the loop (HIL) simulations, and use unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) to reduce any discrepancies between real and simulated data. For this purpose, an UDA facilitated by a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network is proposed. It is shown that the proposed method can significantly improve the multipath detection accuracy on experimental data compared to baseline approaches (including both heuristic approaches and ML-methods). It is also shown that UDA can enhance GNSS estimation performance in the absence of annotated training data, achieving a prediction accuracy in hand-labeled experimental data of as much as 99 \%.},

  abstract = {GPS positioning in urban environments is challenging as tall buildings often block, reflect, or diffract signals. These signals then reach the receiver via a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) path, which may result in positioning errors such that a vehicle using conventional GPS will need to slow down or reroute its course. Improvements can be made through urban mapping that allows the specularity and visibility to be predicted at any location of interest within the mapped environment. Building footprints are raytraced to create a database of visibility and specular skyplots, which display the expected sky visibility and likelihood of specular reflections at any given location. Direct position estimation (DPE) is an alternative positioning approach that directly computes a multi-dimensional spatial correlogram that can be analyzed to determine the most likely user location. This approach requires a priori information about satellites, user location and clock bias, which are all readily established in urban environments. A driving experiment was performed with an equipped vehicle in downtown Denver CO. By examining several regions of interest with varying degrees of conventional GPS positioning success, the use of DPE as well as incorporating visibility and specularity predictions has been shown to improve positioning estimates.},

  abstract = {The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning accuracy is highly degraded due to signal reflections from buildings. A stand-alone receiver only has limited measurement capabilities, thus resulting in limited performance. With the rapid development of communications techniques, sharing measurements between receivers have become possible. Therefore, this study proposed a novel 3D mapping aided (3DMA) GNSS-based cooperative positioning method that makes use of all the available surrounding receivers’ measurements for acquiring better positioning solutions. By complementarily integrating the GNSS ray-tracing algorithm and the double difference technique, the uncorrelated errors are mitigated while eliminating the correlated errors between users. As a result, a more accurate relative positioning solution is achieved, which can further improve the absolute positioning accuracy of the degraded receiver. To improve the robustness of the cooperative positioning algorithm, factor graph optimization is employed to obtain an overall optimal positioning solution among multiple receivers’ solutions. By further integrating the 3DMA GNSS cooperative positioning with factor graph optimization, the positioning accuracy and robustness are improved, and the method achieves a root mean square error of less than 10 meters for most receivers in a dense urban area.},

  abstract = {To explore the mechanical effects of the wing subjected to the aerodynamic loads and turbulence during the flight, this paper presents a finite element analysis of wing flexure deformation. Firstly, a large-aspect-ratio wing model is established. Taking material characteristics, wing structure and design principle into account, the assembly wing model consists of the thin skin, two spars and multi ribs. NACA2412 is chosen as the airfoil, because it shows a better aerodynamic performance according to the calculation. Two spars mainly bear the bending moment and shear force, which are made of titanium alloy to ensure sufficient rigidity. The skin and wing ribs are made of aluminum alloy in order to lighten the structural weight. Then, a modal analysis is applied. The natural frequencies and modal shapes of the first four orders are obtained through the pre-stress modal analysis, which provides data for further studies, especially the harmonic response analysis. The results of the modal analysis help designers to minimize excitation on the natural frequencies and prevent the wing from the flutter. Finally, a transient structural dynamic analysis is carried out. During the flight, the wing is mainly subjected to the structural gravity, component’s point force and aerodynamic loads. By simulating multiple load distributions in ANSYS, the deformation, stress and strain of the wing are calculated. According to the results, designers can put emphasis on strengthening and testing the stress concentration area and large deformation area. The obtained deformation angle benefits the modeling of the wing flexure deformation to decrease the influence of wing flexure in transfer alignment. Overall, the simulation results show that the scheme is feasible and improve the informationization degree of the wing.},

  abstract = {GNSS collaborative positioning receives great attention because of the rapid development of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. Its current bottleneck is in urban areas. During the calculation of double difference of GNSS measurements between two receivers to obtain their relative positions, the notorious multipath effects and NLOS reception in the pseudorange measurement cannot be eliminated. Even worse, these effects become more severe due to the multipath effects of two receivers are aggregated. Recently, the studies explored the use of 3D city models to aid GNSS positioning are increasing. It is widely believed the3D map aided (3DMA) GNSS is a solution to mitigate or even correct the multipath and NLOS effects. This paper therefore investigates the potential to aid GNSS collaborative positioning using 3D city models. The 3D models are used in two phases. The first phase is in single receiver level. The models is used to exclude NLOS measurements based on GNSS shadow matching (SDM) positioning result. The second phase is in multi-receiver level. The 3D building model is used together with broadcast ephemeris data to generate the predicted GNSS positioning error map. Based on the error map, each receiver will be labelled as, good, medium and bad, conditions. The receiver labelled as bad condition will be improved by the receiver labelled as good condition. Five low-cost GNSS receivers are used to conduct a static experiment. According to the result, the positioning accuracy of the receiver located at deep urban canyon will be improved from 26.6 to 17.9 meters, where its SDM result is 19.3 meters.},

  abstract = {The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is currently a dominant method of sensor fusion used for navigation of mobile devices, robotics and autonomous vehicles. One navigation system involves the EKF fusion of an Inertial Navigation System (INS) with a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) to perform 3D pose estimation, which is essential to practical applications like autonomous vehicles and UAVs. This system involves using the INS to predict pose changes and uses GNSS measurements when available to correct for estimation drifts and sensor errors. The performance of the state estimation is heavily dependent on the accurate selection of EKF parameters, leading to the optimal selection of parameters being a critical factor in the design and use of the EKF. In this paper, a methodical and efficient method of EKF parameter tuning is presented. The tuning framework uses nominal parameters generated by Gauss Markov (GM) and Allan Variance (AV) methods that are tuned by Genetic Algorithms (GA) accelerated by a Design of Experiment (DoE) technique to efficiently optimize EKF parameters. This framework has been implemented in MATLAB and tested using simulations and real data. The results demonstrate that GA tuned parameters increases accuracy substantially, and that the DoE technique consistently improves the convergence behavior of the GA.},

  abstract = {The Japanese Centimeter Level Augmentation Service (CLAS), which started operation from November 2018, provides centimeter level positioning accuracy within the service area of Japan. CLAS utilizes the Precise Point Positioning - Real Time Kinematic (PPPRTK) technique by broadcasting compact state space representation (SSR) messages including satellite orbit, clock, code bias, phase bias, tropospheric and ionospheric corrections. To date, SSR message quality and the resulting CLAS positioning performance have not been fully analyzed, especially for low-cost receivers and within urban environments. This research aims to evaluate the performance of CLAS from open sky to urban environments and from geodetic to low-cost receivers. Several issues with CLAS data quality are discussed in this research. Based on these issues, we propose an improved strategy of partial ambiguity resolution (PAR). To evaluate the performance of CLAS and the efficiency of the proposed PAR strategy, GNSS data in both open sky and urban environments was collected by Trimble NetR9 and u-blox F9 receivers. Our results show that the new PAR improves the ambiguity fix rate and time to first fix (TTFF). For the Trimble receiver, accuracy of less than 10 cm in RMS can be achieved in both horizontal and vertical directions. With a fix rate from 92.89\% in a normal urban environment to over 99\% in an open sky environment, the performance of CLAS-based PPP-RTK with PAR meets the performance standard of CLAS. However, the inexpensive u-blox receiver has issues with larger observation noise, inaccurate phase bias, and fewer satellite measurements, which lead to lower fix rates and more instances of false (incorrect) fixing. Hence, a more critical significance level in the ratio test used to validate ambiguity fixing is recommended for CLAS positioning using low-cost receivers.},

  abstract = {In recent research, spatial processing technique based on antenna array has been considered as one of the most effective anti-spoofing methods. This paper provides a novel spoofing suppression scheme based on the Cyclic Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm. In this method, the cyclostationarity of navigation signals are fully excavated to estimate the spatial power spectrum before the despreading process of the receiver. Then, based on the assumption that the spoofing signals with different spurious pseudo random noise (PRN) codes come from one single-antenna source, the spoofing attack can be detected if the power of a certain direction is significantly larger than other directions. Finally, the subspace projection is adopted to eliminate the spoofing signals and beamforming for each satellite ensures that the power of the authentic signals is not attenuated. The proposed technique has lower computational complexity than the post-despreading methods because all the operations are performed on the digitized baseband samples without any modification to the receiver. In addition, different with other pre-despreading methods, this method can accurately estimate the DOAs of the spoofing and authentic signals, which can not only provide higher gain for the authentic signals but also be helpful for the interference source positioning in some applications.},

However, the labeling GM-PHD filter cannot correctly discriminate tracks of individual targets when targets are moving closely to each other. To solve this problem, an improved GM-PHD tracker is proposed, which is able to identify and manage the track of individual target effectively. First, a detection-guided dynamic reweight scheme is employed in the GM-PHD filter to alleviate the weight error of closely spaced targets.

  abstract = {Facilitating modern driving systems requires accurate vehicle positioning, especially in densely built-up urban environments. Despite being a fundamental positioning technology which provides globally referenced solutions, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is known for suffering from signal blockage and multipath effects in urban canyons. Moreover, high-precision GNSS positioning requires the employment of ambiguity-resolved carrier phase measurements from a modest number of satellites, which can be challenging to access in urban environments. Hence, complimentary sensors such as Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) devices are often needed in addition to enable accurate vehicle positioning. In this paper, a lidar-aided instantaneous ambiguity resolution method is proposed. Lidar measurements are generated via a learning-based keypoint extraction strategy by registering point clouds to a pre-built HD map of georeferenced scans. Such measurements are tightly coupled with doubledifferenced GNSS observations in a mixed measurement model to obtain precise float ambiguities. Integer ambiguity resolution is then applied to achieve accurate fixed positioning solutions. Furthermore, a closed-form Ambiguity Dilution of Precision (ADOP) expression is developed to assess and predict the ambiguity resolution performance of the proposed method using the numbers and precision of GNSS and lidar measurements. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed lidar-aided instantaneous ambiguity resolution method can significantly improve the ambiguity resolution performance and positioning accuracy comparing with the GNSS-only approach, while also making single-system single-frequency integer ambiguity resolution feasible.},

  abstract = {Safety-critical localization is essential for unmanned autonomous systems. LiDAR localization gains great popularity in urban canyons due to its high ranging accuracy. Inheriting from the integrity monitoring theory for GNSS, safety-certifiable LiDAR localization first consists in fault detection and exclusion (FDE). In face of numerous LiDAR measurements, conventional chi-square test for FDE is computationally intractable. What’s more, inliers could be mistakenly excluded without reconsideration. This paper proposes a computationally tractable and flexible FDE method. It’s realized via outlier mitigation aided by graduated nonconvexity (GNC) relaxation. The two novel loss functions truncated least square (TLS) and the Geman McClure (GM) are combined respectively. The outlier-mitigated planar-featurebased LiDAR localization is formulated with GNC and TLS or GM. More importantly, a triple-layer optimization method is proposed to solve the localization formulation. Besides the typical GNC relaxation, the control parameter is taken into consideration for tuning the outliers resistance degree. The outlier mitigated pose estimation and the weightings ranging from 0 to 1 for the exploited LiDAR measurements are finally produced. Extensive experiments of the proposed method is conducted on urban dataset. What’s more, considering that TSL and GM provides distinct outlier mitigation patterns, the performances from them are investigated and compared.},

  abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is essential for autonomous driving by providing absolute positioning solutions. However, the performance of GNSS measurement is significantly degraded in urban areas, due to the severe multipath and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) effects. To ensure the operation safety of autonomous driving applications, the GNSS localization performance is required to improve. In this study, a novel vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) based cooperative localization algorithm with double-layers of consistency check (CC) is developed. GNSS pseudorange measurements of the ego-vehicle and surrounding vehicles conduct the first-layer of CC independently to exclude the multipath-biased measurement and obtaining their absolute positions. Then, the survived GNSS measurement and the absolute positions of each vehicles are shared in between, and further applied with double difference (DD) technique to obtain an accurate relative position between the surrounding vehicles. The second-layer CC is conducted during the GNSS DD-based relative positioning, to exclude the multipath and NLOS effects more comprehensively. Finally, the absolute and relative positions of surrounding vehicles are cooperated to optimize the final position of all participating vehicles. By the both simulation and real experimental results, the proposed algorithm is able to mitigate the multipath effect and significantly improve the accuracy of GNSS localization solutions to fulfill the safety requirements for autonomous driving.},

  abstract = {The anti-spoofing techniques based on antenna array can discriminate spoofing from authentic satellite signals according to their directions of arrival, and then project the array signal vector into the orthogonal complement subspace to the spoofing subspace to mitigate spoofing interference. Under the condition that multiple-antenna spoofing source transmits different PRN signals from different directions, however, the spoofing mitigation algorithm based on orthogonal projection may cause serious attenuation for those authentic signals located in or close to the nulls in the antenna beam pattern. In this case, it is difficult to maintain the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of authentic satellite signals in the array output signal, which is not tolerable for some high precision applications. In order to solve this problem, we propose a non-orthogonal projection method based on antenna array for GNSS spoofing mitigation, in which the array weight vector is calculated based on maximum Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) criterion for each authentic satellite signal. The interference nulls can be adjusted to any depth according to the power of spoofing signals while maximizing the gain of the desired satellite signal. Simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm can effectively improve beamforming gain for authentic signals and recover the receiver's positioning precision while eliminating spoofing interference.},

  abstract = {The practice of inertial sensor calibration has commonly been carried out by taking into account the deterministic and stochastic components of the error measurements issued from a calibration session. Once the deterministic components have been taken into account through physical models, the remaining stochastic component has always been dealt with for each sensor separately. The latter process involves estimating complex probabilistic models for each sensor which has been proven to be extremely complicated over the past years, although recent proposals have allowed to overcome most of the limitations that have characterized this task. However, the separate stochastic calibration of the individual sensors composing an inertial measurement unit may not be wise in many cases since there can be considerable degrees of dependence between the sensors, especially between the gyroscopes. For this reason, there has been growing attention towards this issue in order to consider the influence of the stochastic behaviour of the sensors on each other, with few proposals that address this problem. Among these proposals there has been the idea of integrating the information coming from the different gyroscopes so as to build a virtual gyroscope. In this paper we build on this idea and, using a recently proposed method for multivariate signal modelling, we deliver a general and flexible framework that allows to consider many different modelling options which provide the basis to construct a virtual sensor that optimally combines the information from the individual sensors and considerably improves navigation accuracy.},

  abstract = {Constant envelope multiplexing (CEM) techniques are used to combine multiple signals of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), so that signals on adjacent frequencies can be transmitted through a common up-converter, power amplifier chain and antenna on satellite payload. Along with the increasing of number of signal components and bandwidth of components, more sophisticated CEM techniques are required, resulting in that the CEM signals are with more complex composition and of larger bandwidth. The transmitting channel on satellite, however, is of limited bandwidth. After passing these channel, some high frequency components of the wideband CEM signal get lost, which destroys the envelope constant property of signal, thus introduces distortion at high power amplifier (HPA). In order to maintain the envelope constancy and reduce distortion of signal in CEM design, this paper presents a methodology focusing on the envelope constant after the equivalent filter of transmitters. Problem formulation, algorithms and an application example are provided. Comparison is conducted with a traditional CEM solution. Results show that a derived scheme of the proposed CEM design method does reduce the divergence of the envelope after filtering, while achieving compatible performance in power efficiency.The proposed method allows navigation system designers to adjust CEM schemes according to hardware implementation of transmitters on payload, thus reducing the distortion caused by imperfection of payload.},

  abstract = {The scale uncertainty problem is a well-known challenging problem in visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). Since the RGB-D sensor provides scale information, RGB-D SLAM improves this uncertainty problem. And it can greatly reduce the computational complexity of SLAM in depth estimation, thereby improving the real-time performance of SLAM. However, due to the limitations of the physical hardware conditions of the RGB-D sensor, it is difficult to measure the depth of reflective areas, dark areas, and out-of-range areas in real environments. Depth estimation from RGB-D sensors is only available in a limited area, and measurement error also typically increases with distance. Therefore, in extreme and complex environments, the depth map of RGB-D sensors has many holes that lack depth values. These holes can lead to some blind areas on the depth image, which can seriously affect the quality of the depth map. These low-quality depth maps bring great challenges to the accuracy and stability of RGB-D SLAM, and largely limit the application of RGB-D SLAM in real complex environments. In order to reduce the impact of these low-quality depth maps on RGB-D SLAM and further improve the stability and robustness of RGB-D SLAM in complex environments, this paper proposes a robust RGB-D SLAM based on depth map Improvement. At the first stage, based on a public dataset of complex environments, a powerful deep neural network model is trained using machine learning techniques. This model can complete the depth map with hole regions. It obtains the completed pixel-level dense depth map based on the input RGB map and the original depth map. At the next stage, using part of the work of ORB-SLAM2, we conduct secondary development. By combining with this deep neural network that can complete the blind area of the depth map, the basic prototype of our SLAM is obtained. Based on the completed depth map, the performance of our SLAM in complex environments is improved. After estimating more reliable positions and poses for each keyframe, we added the process of map building to the SLAM. Through the alignment and fusion adjustment of each keyframe point cloud map, a visualized 3D map is obtained. Finally, through the complementary combination of traditional SLAM and deep neural network, we get a better performance and more stable RGB-D SLAM. To test and evaluate the RGB-D SLAM proposed in this paper, we first conduct experiments on the existing RGB-D public benchmark datasets. From the experimental results on the datasets, our RGB-D SLAM has good accuracy and reliability. In addition, we also use Intel consumer-grade RGB-D camera Realsense D435 to conduct practical tests in real-world environments. The results show that the RGB-D SLAM proposed in this paper has a significant improvement in stability and robustness. In challenging environments, it can effectively improve the safety, reliability and efficiency of autonomous operating equipment.},

  abstract = {Increased use of global satellite navigation systems (GNSS), for applications such as autonomous vehicles, intelligent transportation systems and drones, heightens security concerns. Civil GNSS signals are vulnerable to notably spoofing and replay attacks. To counter such attacks, cryptographic methods are developed: Navigation Message Authentication (NMA) is one such scheme, about to be deployed for Galileo E1 Open Service (OS); it allows receivers to verify the signal origin and protects navigation message integrity. However, NMA signals cannot fully thwart replay attacks, which do not require forging navigation messages. Classic replay attacks, e.g, meaconing, retransmit previously recorded signals without any modification, thus highly limiting the capacity of the adversary. Distance-decreasing (DD) attacks are a strong type of replay attack, allowing fine-grained individual pseudorange manipulation in real time. Moreover, DD attacks counterbalance processing and transmission delays induced by adversary, by virtue of shifting earlier in time the perceived (relayed) signal arrival; thus shortening the pseudorange measurements. In this paper, we first analyze how DD attacks can harm the Galileo E1 OSNMA service assuming the adversary has no prior information on the navigation message. Moreover,we propose a DD attack detection method based on a Goodness of Fit test on the prompt correlator outputs of the victim. The results show that the method can detect the DD attacks even when the receiver has locked to the DD signals.},

The 3D mapping aided (3DMA) GNSS based collaborative positioning, integrating the 3DMA GNSS ray-tracing algorithm with the GNSS collaborative positioning, can sufficiently improve the positioning accuracy in the urban area, by eliminating the systematic errors and mitigating the multipath and NLOS reception errors simultaneously. However, the effectiveness of the collaborating agent or the collaborator selection strategy for a target agent in the urban area has not been investigated yet. The collaborating agent selection strategy based on the environment context or the measurement spatial correlation will be analyzed. Simulation result shows, collaborating with the agents from the open-sky environment can ensure the qualities of anchor positions and achieve a better collaborative positioning performance. On the other hand, the measurement spatial correlation occurs for the agents with similar environment geometry and improves the quality of relative position constraints during the collaborative positioning. As a result, collaborating with the spatial correlated agents can also achieve an accurate collaborative positioning solution comparing to the collaboration with open-sky agents.},

The IFF-Radar play two roles: firstly, it detects the angle and the range between two AVs, and thus the path between the two vehicles can be modeled as a curve. Secondly, it detects which AV helps form the above curve, and receives the corresponding GPS information from the friend vehicle. Through the cooperation of the multiple AVs, not only GPS can work well with fewer satellites due to the block of canyon environments, but also differential GPS (DGPS) performance can be achieved when the place is beyond the coverage of the DGPS. Theoretical analysis shows that two GPS satellites are sufficient to obtain the location information with the help of two or more friend vehicles, and the performance is as accurate as DGPS with the help of two or more friend vehicles. Simulations show that the proposed approach can achieve better localization by the cooperation among multiple aerial vehicles than single aerial vehicle.},

The differential equation and ARMA process based methods can be deduced from the transfer function of the shaping filter using inverse Laplace and Z transform.

  abstract = {Real-time satellite clock offset anomaly monitoring is of great significance for real-time precise point positioning (RT-PPP) applications. Gross errors and phase jumps are the common anomalies in real-time satellite clock offsets. To detect these anomalies quickly and accurately, a real-time anomaly monitoring method based on generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) and adaptive Kalman filter (AKF) is proposed. The innovation sequence of AKF is used to reflect the abnormal variation of satellite clock offsets. By adjusting the adaptive factors of AKF, a reliable innovation sequence can be obtained. The GLRT is used as a detector to detect anomalies in satellite clock offsets with the aid of innovation sequence. By comparing the likelihood ratio test statistics with a priori detection threshold, the anomalies can be detected in real time. Based on the different performance of anomalies in the innovation sequence, the gross error and phase jump can be distinguished. Numerical simulations are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of AKF in resisting the influences of phase jumps. The performance of the proposed anomaly monitoring method is evaluated, and the results show that the monitoring method can provide a quickly detection and identification of satellite clock offset anomalies and has a low probability of false alarm (PFA) and good probability of detection (PD).},

  abstract = {With the popularity of smartphones and the development of navigation sensor technology, smartphones are expected to serve as unified platform for ubiquitous location services. In land vehicle navigation application, a GPS receiver equipped smartphone can be used for several location-based services. However, short-term GPS outage may occur in urban environment when crossing tunnels or viaducts. An ideal solution could be a combination of GPS and low cost inertial measurement sensors using GPS/SINS integrated navigation algorithm. Traditional GPS/SINS integrated navigation algorithms are based on Kalman type filter with Strap-down Inertial Navigation error propagation model and inertial sensor error model as the system model. However the high uncertainties of nonlinear drift in low cost Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) Inertial Measurement sensors make the errors are difficult to characterize. It is still a challenge to develop an optimal real-time integration algorithm that can maintain required system performance during GPS short-term outage (maximum 30s) for low cost sensors on smartphone. In this paper, we proposed a reliable hybrid positioning method by combining the advantages of belief propagation (BP) and structure learning in the probabilistic graphical model, which addresses GPS outages and uncertain nonlinear drift of MEMS INS simultaneously. The state estimation problem of integrated navigation was formulated in the framework of factor graph. A factor graph is a probabilistic graphical model which combines the graph theory and probability theory to give a multivariate statistical modeling. An unscented transform based belief propagation algorithm was proposed to address multi-rate measurement and partial nonlinear system model. This factor graph based state estimation was augmented by another adaptive probabilistic graphical model which was used to model position error induced by MEMS IMU sensors nonlinear drift. This architecture works in learning mode when GPS measurement is available and works in prediction mode when GPS measurement is in short-term outage. A road-test experiment in a land vehicle was taken in order to verify the method proposed in this paper.},

  abstract = {In dense urban areas, conventional GNSS does not perform satisfactorily, sometimes resulting in errors of tens of metres. This is due to the blocking, reflection and diffraction of GNSS satellite signals by obstructions such as buildings and moving vehicles. The 3D mapping data of buildings can be used to predict which GNSS signals are line-of-sight (LOS) and which are non-line-of-sight (NLOS). These data have been shown to greatly improve GNSS performance in urban environments. Location-based services typically use single-epoch positioning, while all pedestrian and vehicle navigation applications use filtered solutions. Filtering can reduce the impact of noise-like errors on the position solution. Kalman filtering-based solutions have been adopted as one of the standard algorithms for GNSS navigation in many different products, and particle filtering has been demonstrated by several research groups. This paper mainly investigates the performance of different filtering algorithms combined with 3D-mapping-aided (3DMA) techniques. In addition to the Kalman filter and particle filter, the grid filter is also considered. In contrast to a particle filter, the hypotheses of a grid filter are uniformly distributed (forming a grid), but with different likelihoods, which better fits the physics of the problem. At the same time, this allows the current UCL’s single-epoch 3DMA GNSS positioning algorithm to be easily extended to multi-epoch situations. This paper then compares the performance of these continuous positioning algorithms in urban environments.},

Three different test statistics, two in the measurement domain and one in the position domain, are presented. Two 3D city maps with different levels of detail were used, one of which contained two obvious errors, to demonstrate the performance of 3DMA GNSS positioning in the presence of errors in the mapping data. The experiments tested were conducted alongside busy roads in the London Borough of Camden, where a total of 8 sets of 2-minute static pedestrian navigation data were collected with a u-blox EVK M8T GNSS receiver. The results confirm that both 3D mapping errors and temporary environmental changes (such as passing vehicles) can have a significant negative impact on the performance of 3DMA GNSS positioning. After applying outlier detection, single-epoch 3DMA GNSS algorithm reduces the horizontal RMS position error by approximately 15\% compared to that without outlier detection. The filtering algorithm attenuates the effects of temporary environmental changes, providing an improvement of about 15\% over single-epoch positioning, while the outlier algorithm further reduces the RMS error to a comparable level to that of using high-accuracy maps, about 4.7m.},

  abstract = {Spoofing attacks on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) have attracted great attention in recent years due to their severe harm to position, velocity, and timing (PVT) service users. Conventional spoofing techniques focus on disabling the victim by directly broadcasting fake GNSS signals and thus could cause obvious alarms. Meanwhile, covert spoofing techniques require precise information or physical access of the victim to carry out spoofing attacks without triggering alarms, but these conditions are not satisfied in numerous real-world scenarios, especially in remote and temporary cases. In this paper, we design a spoofer framework that is suitable for committing remote GNSS spoofing attacks temporarily and covertly. We describe in detail the control strategy to adjust the key parameters of the spoofing signals including the code phase, Doppler frequency shift, signal strength, and navigation message data bit. The observation module that consists of a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) unit and an attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) unit is utilized to provide supplementary information to ensure the validation of the spoofing attacks. A brief error analysis is provided to represent the performance of the proposed spoofer framework. Finally, we develop a prototype based on the spoofer framework and carry out actual spoofing experiments toward a widely used commercial GNSS receiver. The results show that such temporary and covert spoofing attacks are indeed a practical threat.},

  abstract = {Real-time reliable navigation in urban environments has received academic and commercial interest over recent years. Unfortunately, commercial sensors such as smartphones are implemented with low-cost antennas and chips for receiving satellite signals and suffered from severe signal degrading caused by the non-light-of-sight (NLOS) and multi-path effect. Many conventional methods like extended Kalman filter (EKF) would always perform poorly in the urban environment. Factor graph optimization (FGO) has recently proved its reliable navigation performance in urban environments, utilizing the multi-epoch GNSS measurements to estimate the user position simultaneously. Furthermore, recent studies verified that outlier mitigation technologies using graduated non-convexity (GNC) could effectively improve GNSS positioning performance. However, those studies are mainly concerned with batch optimization which makes the computational load significant and leads to large time consumption, especially while the system integrates the GNC-based robust function in optimization for outlier mitigation. For smartphones application, this study proposed a real-time sliding window-based FGO with the implementation of GNC for outlier mitigation to guarantee reliability and low time consumption. This paper verifies the effectiveness of the contributions of this paper step by step using datasets in Shang Hai and Los Angeles. We also discussed the impact of the different sizes of sliding windows in terms of positioning error and time consumption.},

  abstract = {Highly scalable and available real-time precise satellite orbit and clock corrections are the prerequisite to the development of lowcost real-time Precise Point Positioning (PPP) system. At present, the Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services (RTCM) State Space Representation (SSR) messages are commonly used for representing and disseminating real-time precise satellite orbit and clock corrections. Since RTCM SSR requires a continuous connection between the server and the user ends to transmit the high-rate corrections, real-time PPP positioning accuracy may be affected by the increasing satellite orbit and clock errors during correction outages caused by communication link corruptions, server malfunction, and so on. To better support the development of low-cost real-time PPP systems demanding both high precision and low costs, the improved Legacy Navigation messages (LNAV) is generated by estimating the satellite orbit parameters with International GNSS Service (IGS) ultra-rapid orbits as well as by estimating the satellite clock parameters with real-time correction streams. The improved LNAV has fully-consistent representation and user-end algorithms as the conventional LNAV from the GPS system but with significantly improved accuracy. The update rates of the improved LNAV are fully scalable to accommodate different low-cost real-time PPP systems in terms of communication bandwidth (costs) and accuracy. Furthermore, real-time precise satellite orbit and clock corrections are available for up to 2 hours when correction outages occur so that real-time PPP positioning accuracy can be maintained. In this study, the accuracy of improved LNAV is compared with the RTCM SSR corrections, and the quality degradation during correction outages is analyzed. The positioning performance of the improved GPS LNAV is explored using both static and kinematic datasets from the Android Nexus 9 tablet and U-Blox M8T receivers. The results indicated that the improved LNAV can provide corrections with sufficient accuracy to meet consumer application requirements and can provide high availability even during correction outages. It is concluded that the improved LNAV can be an effective alternative approach for delivering real-time precise corrections of high scalability and availability and can be applied to support the development of next-generation low-cost real-time PPP systems for mass-market applications.},

  abstract = {Object detection is one of the core tasks of computer vision. With the development of artificial neural networks, object detection has been greatly improved and gradually applied to more fields. In urban traffic, object detection can be used for vehicle detection, autonomous driving, and judging traffic conditions. In the process of navigation, satellite remote sensing images can be used to detect urban vehicles to judge traffic conditions. Object detection can also be used to identify obstacles during car driving. Although accurate detection of larger objects in images has been achieved in many applications, accurate detection of smaller objects remains challenging. The main difficulties in the detection of small targets are low resolution, blurred images, and little information carried. As a result, its feature expression ability is weak, that is, in the process of special zone features, very few features can be extracted, which is not conducive to the detection of small targets. This paper proposes an improved Faster R-CNN algorithm for small target recognition in remote sensing images. In this paper, the feature pyramid structure is used to improve Faster R-CNN. Feature pyramid can perform feature extraction on images of each scale, and can generate multi-scale feature representation, and feature maps of all levels have strong semantic information, even including some high-resolution feature maps. Through the feature pyramid structure, the feature expression ability is enhanced, and the small target feature map resolution is increased at the same time. Secondly, the kmeans clustering transformation algorithm is used to optimize the size of the anchor box to improve the matching degree between the prior box and the ground-truth box. And a channel attention mechanism is introduced in feature fusion to highlight important features and reduce redundant features. Remote sensing images are generally obtained by space platforms, and most of the targets are small targets. The attention mechanism considers both the inter-channel relationship and the spatial position relationship, which enables the model to more accurately identify the target and lock the target position. The attention mechanism improves the accuracy and generalization of small object detection. Finally, we validate the model on RSOD-dataset. Through the experimental verification, the framework proposed in this paper can effectively improve the accuracy of small target detection in aerial remote sensing images, and effectively reduce the false alarm rate, which provides a basis for the research of target detection in aerial remote sensing images.},

  abstract = {In recent years, GNSS-based cooperative positioning applications such as multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), multiple unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), and intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) are receiving a great attention. These applications can achieve the information exchange among wireless devices (nodes). As multiple devices equipped with GNSS receivers are feasible to measure the distance and communicate with each other, the positioning performance of a single device can be enhanced greatly by using redundant measurements. Up to now, the focus of GNSS-based cooperative positioning applications is to provide users with high positioning accuracy and availability. Meanwhile, there is also an increasing demand for the integrity of GNSS-based cooperative positioning applications. Compared with conventional GNSS applications, cooperative positioning applications are more vulnerable to the interferences or attacks from the ground. For a cooperative positioning system, the faults occurring at one device could also affect other devices, further resulting in severe positioning errors of each node. Receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM), as a prevalent integrity monitoring method, has shown good performance on detecting and excluding the faults related with satellites. However, some challenges have to be tackled for applying RAIM to GNSS-based cooperative positioning applications including the definition, detection, and exclusion of new fault modes. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the potential faults modes and design an effective RAIM algorithm for cooperative positioning system. In our research, the fault modes related with nodes are firstly introduced. A whole-network extended Kalman filter (WNEKF) is then proposed to integrate the pseudorange measurements of satellites and the ranging measurements between the nodes. Based on solution separation strategy, an integrity monitoring algorithm is developed to detect and exclude the faults. The benefit of our method is that it is conductive to monitor all the faults of the whole network simultaneously. Besides, based on the centralized algorithm, only few master nodes are needed to execute the integrity monitoring algorithm, while the other nodes receive integrity information from the master nodes.},

  abstract = {Under the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Collaborative Robust Integrated Sensor Positioning (CRISP) program, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC) is designing and building a collaborative navigation solution between multiple airborne platforms. The CRISP architecture takes advantage of AFRL’s Layered Sensing construct, which enables platforms to share navigation information, including geo-registered imagery. The system makes use of the higher performing sensors on the high-flyer (HF) platform, which are less susceptible to jamming, and cameras that generate larger sensor footprint and higher resolution images of the terrain. The low-flyers (LFs) have lower-quality navigation sensors, are more likely to be jammed, and have a more limited view of the terrain. Under this scenario, the HF may assist one or more LFs such that they, too, can have similar accuracy as the HF in a GPS-denied environment. This paper presents the progress on the development of the CRISP system, based on the algorithms that have been verified using Government Furnished datasets. Some of the considerations included in the design process of the real time system are also discussed.},

However, the integrity monitoring of visual navigation methods is an essential but hardly-solved topic, since modelling the geometric error for cameras is rather challenging. This work proposes a highprecision geometric error model of detected feature corners for chessboard-like patterns. The model is named as Chessboard Corner Geometric Error Model (CCGEM). By applying the model to images containing chessboard-like patterns, the extracted corner location accuracy can be predicted in different lighting conditions. The coefficients in the model can be adapted to each distinct camera-lens system through a calibration process. The proposed method first models the intensity distribution in the local neighboring area of the extracted corner by taking the raw image as measurement input. Then, the geometric error of the feature location is modelled as a function of the distribution parameters. We show that the model fits the measurement error well in both simulated and real images. The proposed CCGEM also provides a conservative fitting model with risk probability information, which can be applied in the integrity monitoring of vision-based positioning.},

However, other navigation applications emerge that require multi-sensor fusion in varying operational environments. Both the total number of measurements and the number of potentially faulty measurements can increase significantly. For such applications, an exhaustive account of all modes can be challenging and can become computationally intractable. These challenges can be addressed using greedy-search-based fault exclusion.

However, according to the measurement model of cameras, the attitude of the camera has influences on the uncertainty of the position estimates, and vice versa. This work investigates the geometric impact on camera-based localization by using a six degrees-of-freedom dilution of precision including both position and attitude. The attitude is parameterized using Rodrigues parameters instead of Euler angles to avoid Gimbal lock. The geometric impact is analyzed in different scenarios using real images.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel algorithm to enhance the accuracy of urban positioning in mobile applications, without requiring high processing. A multipath model is derived to express the multipath effects on the auto-correlation function (ACF). The multipath model is a function in the code delay error, the multipath code delays, the multipath complex amplitudes, and the composite complex amplitude, which consists of the complex amplitudes of the Line-of-Sight (LOS) signal and all the existing multipath signals. 3D buildings model and an accelerated ray tracing algorithm are used to get predictions for the code delay error and the multipath code delays at a range of possible positions. The predicted parameters are used to estimate the multipath complex amplitudes and the composite complex amplitude using measured correlations. The predicted and the estimated parameters are plugged into the multipath model to get a predicted ACF, for each possible position. The idea is that if the predictions are correct, then the estimations will be correct, which will lead to a predicted ACF that closely match the measured ACF. Therefore, a consistency analysis is performed to measure the consistency between each predicted ACF and the measured ACF. The possible position with the highest consistency is taken as the estimated position. The proposed algorithm is called Correlation Prediction and Consistency Analysis (CPCA). The CPCA algorithm is verified using real GPS data collected in Hong Kong. The results show enhancement in urban position estimation compared to a conventional position estimation method and a vector tracking-based method.},

  abstract = {The ability of a GNSS receiver to adaptively change its tracking strategy based on the surrounding environment will enable robust positioning in wireless and mobile applications under challenging signal conditions. Analysis of the received Line-of Sight (LOS) signal and multipath signals indicated that their characteristics depend on the surrounding environment. This paper introduces several algorithms that utilize this dependency to enable adaptive tracking. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based algorithm is introduced to estimate the multipath channel. A machine-learning pattern-recognition algorithm is introduced to identify the surrounding environment from the multipath channel characteristics. A tracking strategy selector module is then activated to decide on a tracking strategy that best suits the current signal condition.},

  abstract = {GNSS receivers in urban areas suffer from degraded positioning accuracy due to reflected signals. When a receiver is moving, the same satellite signal could continue to change its status. A signal status could be Line-Of-sight (LOS), multipath, non-LOS (NLOS), or invisible where the LOS is completely blocked. The change in a signal status presents an extra challenge when developing a multipath mitigation algorithm. This is because an efficient multipath mitigation algorithm should be able to detect changes in a signal status and adjust its performance accordingly.},

  abstract = {Nowadays missions at Geostationary (GEO) altitude mainly use traditional ranging for orbit determination and satellite control. The utilization of GNSS receivers on-board a GEO platform is becoming an attractive alternative for position and timing determination, mostly for ground operations minimization and associated cost benefits. To increase competitiveness, electric propulsion to perform or complement the transfer manoeuvres that allow the spacecraft to reach GEO orbit will be employed [15]. This imposes long duration manoeuvres (typically 3–6 months of quasi-continuous thrust) and will result in orbits that intersect several times the “GNSS Sphere”. The GNSS-based navigation performance in these kinds of orbits are strongly influenced by the potentially high GNSS signal power dynamics, by interference from different signals transmitted by the same system (so called intra-system interference) and interference from signals transmitted by other systems (known as inter-system interference). Therefore, the well-known “near-far problem” and the multiple access interference (MAI) may affect significantly the signal acquisition and tracking capabilities, especially when High-Sensitivity GNSS receivers (HS-GNSS) must be employed, constrained by specific missions’ targets (e.g. solution availability and continuity). In this paper, a suitable mitigation technique against the near-far problem and MAI for GNSS Space applications is presented and discussed, taking into account the constraints of nowadays state-of-art GNSS Spaceborne Receiver architecture in the context of GEO-Transfer Orbit (GTO) or Medium-Altitude Transfer Orbit (MTO). The technique is applicable also to Highly Elliptical Orbits (HEO) or all the orbits that intersect the GNSS Sphere. A discussion on the hardware/software implementation strategy is provided. A set of simulations that consider the specificity of the GNSS Space Service Volume (SSV), in terms of expected signal and power dynamics, are carried out and results providing statistics on the effectiveness of the method are shown. The simulation and the input datasets containing crosscorrelation (CC) events have been obtained through a GNSS Bit-True Signal Simulator in MATLAB that will be briefly described hereafter.},

  abstract = {A novel joint tracking loop for multifrequency signals transmitted from a GNSS satellite is proposed. The method makes use of a beamforming technique that is conventionally applied to antenna arrays, but used here to combine signals of several frequency bands. It increases the robustness to deep amplitude fades and interference of jammers, while preserving the conventional receiver architecture including the correlators, discriminators, loop filters and carrier aiding. Doing so certifications of Rx processing in safety-critical applications can be performed by following well established procedures. In the case of no interference the Signal-toNoise-Ratio (SNR) is amplified by the number of employed multifrequency signals.},
