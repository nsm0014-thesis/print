\section{Guidance System}
For commercial flights, it is important for the aircraft to know where the final destination is and how to fly there in an efficient and effective manner. These questions are usually answered by the guidance system and the pilots are provided a flight plan before taking off. The guidance system provides a time series of instructions to feed into the aircraft control to mandate the speed of the aircraft, the altitude of the aircraft, and what radius to bank about with making turns along the journey to the final destination. A similar guidance system is implemented for simulated flight vehicle demonstrated in this thesis.
